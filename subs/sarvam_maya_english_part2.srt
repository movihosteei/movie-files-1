1
00:00:03,167 --> 00:00:04,751
Delulu means delusion.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,167
Seeing things that don't exist.

3
00:00:07,542 --> 00:00:09,417
What's the Malayalam word
for delusion?

4
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:11,792
The Malayalam word for delusion...

5
00:00:12,876 --> 00:00:13,876
"Delulu" works.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,250
Actually, it's cute.

7
00:00:15,584 --> 00:00:17,083
You can just call me Delulu
from now on.

8
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,709
- Delulu!
- Delulu...

9
00:00:20,292 --> 00:00:22,334
Can you please stop ordering
all these clothes?

10
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:24,125
I'm a little short on cash right now.

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,834
Let me explain why, Prabha.

12
00:00:26,209 --> 00:00:28,250
I remember every outfit
I used to wear.

13
00:00:28,584 --> 00:00:30,542
But my favourite kurti...

14
00:00:30,584 --> 00:00:32,459
The white one with
lavender flowers on it...

15
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,083
I simply can't wear that one now.

16
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,876
So I thought, maybe I
could wear it if I saw it.

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,250
Oh.

18
00:00:39,918 --> 00:00:40,918
Hey...

19
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,167
Can you conjure up
a 500 rupee note?

20
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:45,751
Hey! I'm not some genie
you summon from a bottle!

21
00:00:45,918 --> 00:00:47,959
I can handle a few simple things.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I have some skills.

23
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:52,083
Like last week, when that guy acted smart
with you, and I made his bike crash.

24
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,250
Stuff like that.

25
00:00:53,292 --> 00:00:54,667
Which guy?
Sreekuttan?

26
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:55,959
I don't know his name.

27
00:00:56,292 --> 00:00:58,042
Oh my God!!!

28
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:00,542
Oh, sorry!
Not God, not God.

29
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,125
Actually, I do remember
certain things about myself.

30
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:09,334
Like my lifestyle, my habits,
my interests.

31
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:12,667
But I can't remember
any of the main things.

32
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:14,959
Like my family,
or my friends...

33
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:17,042
Nothing at all!

34
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:19,292
Except for one thing.

35
00:01:19,334 --> 00:01:20,375
What's that?

36
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:23,584
Right before I died,
someone, somewhere, said "Yes."

37
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:26,542
It's like someone wanted me to die.

38
00:01:27,584 --> 00:01:28,584
Who was it?

39
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:30,250
I don't know.

40
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,250
Well... I meant to say this
back at the studio.

41
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,667
You have a beautiful voice, Delulu.

42
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:37,709
You're gifted.

43
00:01:39,042 --> 00:01:40,626
If you hadn't died...

44
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,375
you would've become a star.

45
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,834
Now that I'm dead,
becoming a star is my only option, right?

46
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:20,292
"When someone sat close to me at night,
like new-fallen rain in cool delight"

47
00:02:20,334 --> 00:02:25,918
"My heart shifted, lighter than ever,
turning at once to a moonlit river"

48
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:30,626
"Slowly unfolding its wings
in tender delight"

49
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:34,042
"Weaving a chain of laughter
pure and bright"

50
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:39,667
"My mind fills up
on its own tonight"

51
00:02:40,918 --> 00:02:46,542
"Come, let's go to distances
we've never seen"

52
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:52,918
"Becoming two lovely,
colourful clouds serene"

53
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,584
"In this new birth
where our paths convene"

54
00:02:54,626 --> 00:03:00,542
"Let's find our shelter on a blossom
branch kissed by morning dew"

55
00:03:00,584 --> 00:03:04,000
"Becoming the breath
that rises soft and true"

56
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:08,167
"Till every painful memory
softens and bids adieu"

57
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:03,167
Stop!

58
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:10,083
"From which stretch of sky
did I fall and fly"

59
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,500
"A lost little star
slipping out of the sky?"

60
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:19,250
"Who else must I search for
as days drift by?"

61
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:23,792
"I still don't know
the right paths to surmise"

62
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:27,250
"Yet I carried a deep desire
for a safe haven's rise"

63
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:33,292
"Which lingered as moisture
gently filling my eyes"

64
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:37,459
"In all this rush
that surrounds me endlessly"

65
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,042
"Isn't there someone nearby
who cares for me?"

66
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:44,083
"Even at my lightest mischief,
soft and carefree"

67
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,876
"Doesn't he keep smiling,
happily?"

68
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:54,626
"Will you join your hands
and shape a swing?"

69
00:04:54,667 --> 00:05:01,500
"If you do, I will step forward with joy
and gently begin to swing"

70
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:08,375
"When someone sat close to me at night,
like new-fallen rain in cool delight"

71
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:13,959
"My heart shifted, lighter than ever,
turning at once to a moonlit river"

72
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:18,500
"Slowly unfolding its wings
in tender delight"

73
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:22,083
"Weaving a chain of laughter
pure and bright"

74
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:27,709
"My mind fills up
on its own tonight"

75
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:01,334
[Astrologer: Krishnanunni Panicker]

76
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,042
So you just want me to visit
the houses you're trying to sell?

77
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:05,959
Not every one of them, Rupe.

78
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,042
Only the ones where
unnatural deaths have happened.

79
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:12,083
Yes, houses where notorious murders
have occurred.

80
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,459
And suicides.

81
00:06:13,876 --> 00:06:15,250
Altogether,

82
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,709
I've got nearly 28 such houses
on hold across Kerala.

83
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:21,042
Will one puja take care
of all of them?

84
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,751
Not like that. First, I will do
an astrological assessment

85
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:25,626
and then determine
the required remedies.

86
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:27,334
After that, you just have to
carry them out.

87
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,334
Your learned cousin is the one

88
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,500
who went for the lawyer's
son's puja that day, right?

89
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:33,417
He's very skilled.
It'd be great if he came too.

90
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,417
No chance!
Prabhendu works only part-time.

91
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:36,792
He only deals with
cases involving children.

92
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:39,292
Risky cases like these
are handled by me personally.

93
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,042
Yes, what is it?

94
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,292
I'm looking for the office
of the family court lawyer.

95
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:44,542
Is it a mutual divorce?

96
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:46,375
No. I'm okay with it.

97
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:48,042
But my wife is the one
who wants to end it.

98
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,876
That's something
we can resolve right here.

99
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:51,500
Still, go meet the lawyer.

100
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:53,042
- It's the office next door.
- Okay.

101
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:56,083
So, what about the payment?

102
00:06:56,125 --> 00:07:00,417
What if there's more than one ghost in
those houses where mass murders occurred?

103
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:02,125
That depends.

104
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:04,626
We'll even leave some
room for you to negotiate.

105
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,500
If that's the case... err...

106
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:10,751
a per-head rate for each ghost.

107
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,334
- Isn't it okay?
- Okay.

108
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,334
Okay!

109
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,626
Lord Guruvayurappa!

110
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:21,667
Just hold this
and give it one pull.

111
00:07:23,584 --> 00:07:24,584
Wow, this is so easy!

112
00:07:24,626 --> 00:07:25,792
Also, no tears wasted.

113
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:26,834
Thulasi!

114
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,083
Your dad!

115
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:33,375
Grab Pappu's blue spray
from the kitchen.

116
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:35,876
Or never mind.
I'll come there.

117
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:37,667
Okay.

118
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:38,709
Indutty...

119
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,375
Your dad is coming.

120
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:42,292
Get going. I'll call you
when lunch is ready.

121
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,834
Huh?!
You're here?

122
00:07:58,209 --> 00:07:59,500
Who is in there then?

123
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:04,042
It... it...
it's from the speaker, Uncle.

124
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:07,209
Then how did it stop now?

125
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,834
Oh, really?
Let me check.

126
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:15,667
Hey, don't pull these kinds of stunts
when I'm not around.

127
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:17,709
Sorry!

128
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,918
I thought you had grand plans
for cooking today?

129
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,167
What happened?
Finished helping her already?

130
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:26,876
Well... it's just...

131
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,167
Dad was there with Pappu.

132
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,334
So I just came back inside.

133
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,459
By the way, why aren't you two
talking to each other?

134
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:36,000
What's the reason?

135
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:37,584
It's because of Pappu.

136
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,500
What did Pappu do?

137
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,125
Well...

138
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,709
The day my mom passed away...

139
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:46,459
everyone was here.

140
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,584
It was chaotic,
with all the crying and commotion.

141
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:52,209
When it was time
to take her body away,

142
00:08:52,584 --> 00:08:54,083
Pappu suddenly started
barking non-stop.

143
00:08:55,584 --> 00:08:57,125
Mom was his favourite person.

144
00:08:57,751 --> 00:08:59,417
He was tied up
in the backyard then.

145
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:01,918
So I hurried out
and brought him inside.

146
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,584
He deserved to see Mom
one last time, right?

147
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,751
The moment Dad saw him,
he shouted,

148
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:11,417
"Both of you, get out!"

149
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,000
Dad never liked animals.

150
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:17,209
He wouldn't even look at Pappu.

151
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,959
I took him and stood outside...

152
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,626
until all the rituals were over.

153
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:28,667
Dad took away...

154
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,292
the last chance for me
and Pappu...

155
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,667
to be with Mom.

156
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:37,834
From that day on,
I've barely spoken to him.

157
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,083
And neither has Dad, not since I removed
my sacred thread.

158
00:09:42,918 --> 00:09:44,125
But that was back then, right?

159
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,459
Now you've got
your sacred thread again,

160
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
and your Dad is now
Pappu's favourite person.

161
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:49,876
Then why aren't you two talking?

162
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:52,459
It's not possible now.

163
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,542
We just… got set that way.

164
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:55,167
Then just reset it!

165
00:09:55,751 --> 00:09:56,751
Look, Prabha...

166
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:59,709
staying upset with someone
and holding onto it forever...

167
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:01,334
it's simply exhausting.

168
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:03,626
Life's too short for all that!

169
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,250
Hmm.

170
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:07,042
Point.

171
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:08,334
Thank you.

172
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:18,250
Errr...

173
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,584
I'm on the phone, Uncle.

174
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:21,667
Thulasi has called
us to have lunch.

175
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:22,834
Come on.

176
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:31,125
Yes, I'll be there.

177
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:32,792
I'll tell Indu.

178
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:33,918
Alright.

179
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,375
- Was that Neelakandan?
- Yes.

180
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:37,667
Deepu chettan has come home,
along with everyone.

181
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:39,876
He called to ask if Indu
will attend the temple festival.

182
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:42,459
Uncle is hesitant
to ask him directly.

183
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,584
Indu had lunch, took his bike,
and went off somewhere.

184
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:46,751
Is that so?

185
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,167
Uncle...

186
00:10:49,584 --> 00:10:51,542
Has Indu been acting
a little unusual lately?

187
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,500
- Ha! I was just about to ask you that.
- Oh really?

188
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:55,709
- One thing's certain.
- What?

189
00:10:55,751 --> 00:10:57,667
- He's possessed.
- By a ghost?

190
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:59,542
Not a ghost!
Possessed by love for a girl!

191
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:01,417
How do you know?

192
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:02,959
I caught him red-handed today.

193
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,584
He was whispering away
on the phone.

194
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:07,167
From the looks of it,

195
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,250
it was definitely a girl
on the other end.

196
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:11,000
Oh! I had no idea!

197
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:13,667
There's a lot
you've got no idea about!

198
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,209
Do you even know
all the puja rituals?

199
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,417
Well,

200
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:20,250
you should've thought of that when
you got your sister married to a cook!

201
00:11:20,584 --> 00:11:22,334
The fact that I made it this far
from that background

202
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,542
is purely because of
my own talent!

203
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:24,959
That much I'll accept.

204
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:27,375
Uncle...

205
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:30,334
I'm thinking of
focusing on exorcisms.

206
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,584
There are families that have been
doing that for generations, Rupe.

207
00:11:33,918 --> 00:11:36,250
To avoid the side effects,

208
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:40,375
you need the expertise and spiritual energy
passed down through generations.

209
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,334
I'm doing this after proper study.

210
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:43,667
So I'm not scared.

211
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:45,292
- Fear is a good thing!
- Huh?!

212
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:48,375
Fear was the very first emotion
humans ever had...

213
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,000
for basic safety.

214
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,918
I do follow basic safety precautions
when I perform exorcisms.

215
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,584
There are three types of spirits.
Do you know?

216
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:57,042
Hmm. I don't.

217
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,375
Randukama...

218
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,667
Bhokthukama...

219
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:01,042
and Handukama.

220
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,083
The first two are relatively harmless.

221
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:06,584
But the Handukama
comes only to kill!

222
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:08,792
It won't go back
without taking a life.

223
00:12:12,918 --> 00:12:13,918
Oh god!

Born in '88.

230
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,834
Try to remember...
Could your name be Tessa?

231
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:31,375
No! Born in '88 means
she's over 30!

232
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,209

233
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:34,709
About twen--

00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,250
Thirty-thirty two!

235
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:37,959
What?! I'm not that old!

236
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,000
Are there any other

00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,167
It's alright.
We'll keep looking.

242
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:54,834
I just wish I could at
least remember my name.

243
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,500
Don't worry, Delulu.

244
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,709
We will keep trying.

245
00:12:58,042 --> 00:12:59,083
Won't we, Lillykutty?

246
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,792
- Did you know my grandmother?
- Huh?

247
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,751
I asked whether you
knew my grandmother.

248
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:06,167
Yes… your grandmother…

249
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:08,500
I went to her tuition
classes back in eighth grade.

250
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:10,083
Don't you recognize us?

251
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:11,542
Yes, I do.

Are there any other
new cemeteries nearby?

257
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:25,876
Cemetery?
There's St. George Cemetery.

258
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:27,542
I already went there.

259
00:13:27,584 --> 00:13:28,626
Anything else, dear?

260
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:30,250
Then... there's Paleparambil...

261
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:31,417
Did you go to Paleparambil Church?

262
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:32,751
Yeah, I went there too.

263
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,083
There are no other cemeteries.

264
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,375
None, huh?
Hmm, alright then.

00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,667
Okay, get up.

271
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:18,959
I brought him.
But he didn't come inside.

272
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,083
Go check on him, Rupe.
Ask him to come and be here.

00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:42,918
It didn't pop?

280
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:43,959
Not even close!

281
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,876
Guess I've lost my teddy bear.

The answer lies
within the question itself.

340
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:41,959

00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:12,584
I am a nice spirit!

357
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:13,792
A good soul.

358
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:14,876
Sorry, sorry!

359
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:17,250
I'm not entirely convinced
about you either, Delulu.

360
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:21,000
I keep calming myself down by thinking
you're nothing more than my imagination.

361
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:23,417
A very powerful and
impactful hallucination.

362
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:25,459
Oh Jesus!

363
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,626
So you're saying
my skills are worthless?

364
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:29,042
Ha! Skills?

365
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,876
You're still on a learner's permit!

366
00:18:30,918 --> 00:18:32,375
You tried switching on the light
and blew the bulb!

367
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:33,626
Can you even touch anyone at all?

368
00:18:34,042 --> 00:18:35,042
Pathetic!

369
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:38,876
Yes, I can.

370
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:41,667
Huh?!

371
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:54,709
This...

372
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:57,042
This breeze that hit me just now...

373
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,500
That was my touch.

374
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,292
Breeze is the easiest medium
to do that.

375
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:01,959
A soft breeze.

376
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:07,667
Give me the phone.

377
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:12,751
Let me see
if I can take a picture.

378
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:14,292
Go ahead.
You won't get anything.

379
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:19,167
Did it work?

380
00:19:19,876 --> 00:19:20,918
Let me try a video.

381
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,125
Hmm.

382
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:25,042
Did it work now?

383
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,250
You won't see me in it.

384
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:35,250
Google Pay is risky.
Do you have cash?

385
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:37,167
Crush it properly,
mix it with water and have it.

386
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,292
Okay bro, thanks.

387
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:39,334
Huh?

388
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:41,042
- Hey!
- Where?

389
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:42,709
What is it?

390
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:43,751
What is it?

391
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,167
Wait, we're coming.
Come on.

392
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm screwed!

393
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:50,542
Come on, get up!
Let's go!

394
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:51,626
What's wrong?

395
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:52,918
I'll tell you later.
Let's go!

396
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,792
Hello... how high are you...

397
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:00,709
I mean... Hi... how are you?

398
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:02,167
What were you filming
on your phone?

399
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:03,792
No, I wasn't filming you guys!

400
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,584
He'll show it
to the cops, Sreerag.

401
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:07,083
Didn't we chase this guy off
the other day?

402
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,042
Don't you remember?

403
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,125
Boys, honestly,
I have nothing against you.

404
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:13,667
Give me your phone.

405
00:20:13,918 --> 00:20:15,167
Don't give it to them, Prabha.

406
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:17,918
Let me deal with this.

407
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:21,334
You can check my gallery.

408
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,584
I haven't taken any pictures!

409
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:24,584
These guys are so rude, Prabha!

410
00:20:24,626 --> 00:20:25,626
Grab the phone from him.

411
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:27,250
Just be quiet, Delulu!

412
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:28,667
- Huh?
- Huh?

413
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:29,709
- Huh?
- Huh?

414
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:31,751
Hit him, Prabha!

415
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,626
- Idiots!
- Delulu, please!

416
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:34,918
I can solve this!

417
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:36,209
What's wrong with this guy?

418
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,751
Just give me the phone, Kiddo.

419
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:39,167
I don't usually get involved
in things like these.

420
00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:40,959
I don't even know
who you guys are.

421
00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:43,876
How about I let you know?

422
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,042
Alright then.

423
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,250
Okay.

424
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:16,459
Let's go.

425
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:25,667
Sreerag...

426
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:26,709
Hey!

427
00:21:29,292 --> 00:21:30,334
I just...

428
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:32,209
I got high all of a sudden.

429
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,042
- Is he gone?
- Yeah, perfect!

430
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:36,959
While you stood there like a tableau,
he walked off with the phone.

431
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,918
Huh? When?

432
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:39,250
Come on! If we hurry,
we can catch him.

433
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:41,959
Right!

434
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,751
Are they following us?

435
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:47,500
- Yes.
- Oh no!

436
00:21:47,876 --> 00:21:49,083
They are just kids, Prabha.

437
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,584
This is bad,
this is really bad!

438
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:51,792
Stop for a second, Prabha.

439
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:54,834
Are you planning to spend your
whole life being scared like this?

440
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:57,667
Are you?

441
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:01,542
No.

442
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:10,292
[Song from Ottam Thullal
Kerala Traditional song]

443
00:22:10,334 --> 00:22:11,334
Oh no!

444
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:18,709
Dude, go get him!

445
00:22:50,834 --> 00:22:52,876
- Where's my bike key?
- Huh?

446
00:22:52,918 --> 00:22:54,083
The bike key, where is it?

447
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,417
Can we talk after this?

448
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:56,626
Fine, fine.

449
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,125
- Hereafter...
- Hereafter?

450
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:20,959
- If you ever pull this kind of stunt--
- "on this street again..."

451
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:23,500
- I'll smash your face--
- "and change its shape," right?

452
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:25,500
- Yes!
- That's fine, Chetta. No problem.

453
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:26,375
- Hmm.
- Right.

454
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:27,918
Scram!

455
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:29,250
Oh, sorry, Chetta!

456
00:23:34,709 --> 00:23:36,292
- All good?
- Absolutely!

457
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:37,834
Let's go!

458
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,542
What's the check-in time?

459
00:23:46,584 --> 00:23:47,918
Ah... At 2:00 PM.

460
00:23:48,834 --> 00:23:50,125
And the return flight?

461
00:23:51,042 --> 00:23:54,167
That... we'll book that only
after tomorrow's recording.

462
00:23:57,626 --> 00:24:00,292
Deepu Chetta, the reason I didn't
enter the temple yesterday...

463
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:02,667
It's not something
anyone should be forced to do.

464
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,834
It's your choice.

465
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,083
God is inside us, after all.

466
00:24:07,751 --> 00:24:10,542
Temples and churches
are just like mirrors

467
00:24:10,876 --> 00:24:12,334
that reflect that power.

468
00:24:13,876 --> 00:24:15,334
Dad's a bit upset...

469
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:18,292
that even after taking up pujas,
I still avoid entering temples.

470
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:20,834
I've already talked to him
and sorted it out.

471
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:24,334
Dad knows very well how
sincerely you perform the pujas.

472
00:24:24,876 --> 00:24:26,918
And that's why
your pujas are so effective.

473
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:28,334
Exactly!

474
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,375
Hey...

475
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:30,709
- What is it?
- What is it?

476
00:24:30,918 --> 00:24:31,834
- Huh?
- Huh?

477
00:24:31,876 --> 00:24:33,250
- What?
- Don't you hear a sound...

478
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:34,209
coming from the car?

479
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,375
- Really?
- Yes.

480
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:36,834
Oh, yeah.

481
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:38,792
You've got such sharp ears, Indu!

482
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:41,542
Looks like the car is due
for a service.

483
00:24:41,709 --> 00:24:42,834
Yes, yes.

484
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:49,500
17-B

485
00:24:50,209 --> 00:24:51,876
You can sit here, Prabha.
I'll be over there.

486
00:25:16,584 --> 00:25:17,918
I was in Bangalore.

487
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:20,000
Yes. I was in Bangalore.

488
00:25:21,876 --> 00:25:23,584
Did you board the wrong flight?

489
00:25:23,876 --> 00:25:25,334
This flight is going to Mumbai.

490
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:27,125
Prabha! It's me, Delulu!

491
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:29,375
Huh?

492
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:31,459
But how? You've started
possessing people now?

493
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,125
How else can I talk to you?

494
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:34,667
This girl was a perfect fit.

495
00:25:34,918 --> 00:25:37,167
Hmm! Your 'perfection'
is getting out of hand!

496
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:38,500
Yes, yes.
Prabha, listen.

497
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:40,959
I used to fly from Kochi
airport to Bangalore.

498
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,167
I'm very sure.

499
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,792
Did getting on the flight
trigger her memories?

500
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:47,000
Quick! Remember the rest.

501
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:48,083
Who was the one who said "Yes"?

502
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,083
Think quickly!

503
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:53,125
Even half of it is fine.

504
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:55,042
We'll figure out the rest
on the return flight.

505
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:01,584
Don't stress yourself.

506
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,959
Perhaps it will just come back
bit by bit.

507
00:26:05,709 --> 00:26:06,709
Prabha...

508
00:26:06,751 --> 00:26:08,667
I'm sensing something else too.

509
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,250
What is it?

510
00:26:12,292 --> 00:26:14,250
Now that I've remembered
this one thing,

511
00:26:14,292 --> 00:26:15,667
I feel much lighter.

512
00:26:16,584 --> 00:26:18,751
It feels like a burden
has been taken off me.

513
00:26:19,876 --> 00:26:21,042
That's a good thing, right?

514
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:23,209
Guess you're on your way
to salvation.

515
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,000
I think once you find out
who said that 'Yes,'

516
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,584
you'll move on for good.

517
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:28,918
Full free!

518
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,542
So you won't miss me if I go?

519
00:26:31,209 --> 00:26:32,334
Ha, great!

520
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:34,918
Isn't it more important
that you get your freedom?

521
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,167
Salvation is important!

522
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:37,584
Wow!

523
00:26:37,626 --> 00:26:38,959
So you won't miss me at all, huh?

524
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:52,834
Psst!

525
00:26:55,042 --> 00:26:56,083
Psst!

526
00:26:57,334 --> 00:26:58,334
Psst!

527
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:02,125
Yeah?

528
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:04,334
I'll miss you too.

529
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,125
What?!

530
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:07,876
I will miss you.

531
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,250
Psst! Prabha!

532
00:27:10,751 --> 00:27:12,209
Sorry! I lost the connection.

533
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:20,959
Sorry, Madam.

534
00:27:21,417 --> 00:27:22,751
- Creep!
- Yup!

535
00:27:26,751 --> 00:27:28,167
I knew you'd miss me!

536
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:31,375
[mocking] I knew you'd miss me!

537
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,042
Hello?

538
00:28:03,209 --> 00:28:04,334
No.

539
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:05,667
He's almost here.

540
00:28:07,209 --> 00:28:09,375
I've packed all his things
in carton boxes.

541
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:13,167
His clothes, shoes, and books.

542
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,250
And the bluetooth
speaker he gifted me.

543
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:20,834
Hey, he's here.
I'll call you later.

544
00:28:20,876 --> 00:28:21,918
Thanks, dear.

545
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:33,667
Hey...

546
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:35,000
Are you okay, Saadhya?

547
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:36,417
I'll be fine.

548
00:28:36,459 --> 00:28:37,500
Don't worry.

549
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:39,626
These are your things.

550
00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:42,626
Thanks.

551
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:46,542
- See, I--
- I'm getting late for work.

552
00:28:47,209 --> 00:28:48,250
You take care, okay?

553
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:49,334
Enjoy New York.

554
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:04,751
Superb!

555
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:05,959
Didn't I tell you?

556
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:18,417
He is such a find, Saadhya!

557
00:29:18,459 --> 00:29:20,083
Prabhendu, beautiful!

558
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,083
Please come here.

559
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:22,125
Thank you, sir.

560
00:29:28,751 --> 00:29:30,250
She is the one who found you.

561
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:31,709
- Oh.
- Hi.

562
00:29:31,918 --> 00:29:32,918
Saadhya.

563
00:29:33,584 --> 00:29:34,876
Faizal keeps talking about you.

564
00:29:34,918 --> 00:29:36,918
He's your biggest
well-wisher, Prabhendu.

565
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,083
- Oh!
- Shift to Mumbai soon.

566
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:40,125
We need you here.

567
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:41,167
Sure, sir.

568
00:29:41,626 --> 00:29:43,000
- Just a minute, Saadhya.
- Ah, sure, sir.

569
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:44,334
- Come on.
- Okay.

570
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:46,334
Good night, Prabhendu.
Until next time.

571
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:47,459
See you, sir.

572
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
See you.

573
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,250
I'm officially your fan, Prabha!

574
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:56,542
How do you play so well?

575
00:29:56,584 --> 00:29:58,792
Well, that's just how talented I am!

576
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:00,584
Ugh!

577
00:30:00,626 --> 00:30:02,459
Rupa has scheduled a puja
for tomorrow evening!

578
00:30:02,876 --> 00:30:03,876
What do we do?

579
00:30:05,876 --> 00:30:09,083
I've sent you the door password
for the service apartment.

580
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:10,375
The location too.

581
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:12,000
- It's close by.
- Got it.

582
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:13,459
Are you okay with the
evening flight tomorrow?

583
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,876
Err... is it possible to get a flight
that lands before noon tomorrow?

584
00:30:17,209 --> 00:30:19,000
Ah... there's one at 6:30 AM.

585
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:20,083
Will that do?

586
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:21,459
I'm on that flight too.

587
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,918
Yeah, that's fine.

588
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:25,417
Okay.

589
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:26,459
Yes, it's okay.

590
00:30:29,334 --> 00:30:30,334
Okay.

591
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:31,959
You had dinner?

592
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
No.

593
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:34,751
Come on.
You can leave your bag here.

594
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:35,792
Okay.

595
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:37,876
Let's go.

596
00:30:38,292 --> 00:30:40,375
We need to leave
for the airport at 4:30 AM.

597
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:42,125
- Okay.
- It'll be busy since it's the morning.

598
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:46,542
I brought my bags, thinking the
recording would go on all night.

599
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:48,542
You're amazing, Prabhendu!

600
00:30:48,584 --> 00:30:50,042
You finished it so fast!

601
00:30:56,751 --> 00:30:58,709
Pretty cool breeze, huh?
[mimicking Nivin Pauly]

602
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,167
Sorry.

603
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:08,209
She seems to be in
some kind of trouble.

604
00:31:09,042 --> 00:31:10,083
I'll check.

605
00:31:14,209 --> 00:31:16,500
Ugh! Classic heartbreak!

606
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:18,209
- Poor thing!
- Oh.

607
00:31:21,542 --> 00:31:22,709
Aren't you eating?

608
00:31:23,209 --> 00:31:24,209
Huh?

609
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,876
I asked...
aren't you eating?

610
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:30,459
Her boyfriend dumped her, Prabha.

611
00:31:30,626 --> 00:31:31,834
Commitment issues.

612
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:33,959
Stop it, Delulu!

613
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:37,751
Poor girl. Still, she's handling
the situation so maturely.

614
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:39,250
Yeah.

615
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:41,209
Prabha, just ask her
if she's fine, no?

616
00:31:41,792 --> 00:31:43,000
Uh... uh... uh...

617
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:44,584
What uh, uh, uh?

618
00:31:44,626 --> 00:31:46,292
Don't just keep staring!
Say something!

619
00:31:47,459 --> 00:31:48,584
Saadhya...

620
00:31:48,876 --> 00:31:50,375
Aren't you eating
the bun and gravy?

621
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,417
Pav Bhaji.

622
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,584
Ah, Pav Bhaji.

623
00:32:16,709 --> 00:32:20,584
Even though
I'm really angry with him...

624
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:24,918
he is actually a good guy.

625
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:36,792
My first instinct was to block him,
just like anyone would.

626
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,959
But then, I decided to
go through with it,

627
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,167
even though
it's a painful process.

628
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:46,751
It's better for getting
a proper closure.

629
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,459
Sometimes,

630
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,834
we can only blame the situation,
not the person.

631
00:32:55,918 --> 00:32:58,209
If someone walks out of your life,

632
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,542
it's important to keep
your heart clear.

633
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:04,209
No anger, no grudges...

634
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,500
wishing only the best for them.

635
00:33:09,918 --> 00:33:10,959
It's not easy.

636
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,459
But...

637
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,417
we get healed
just by being nice to them.

638
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:29,834
Prabha...

639
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,459
Are you able to see me?

640
00:33:36,584 --> 00:33:37,584
Yeah.

641
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:40,167
I think I was in love.

642
00:33:42,459 --> 00:33:44,375
I was in love with someone.

643
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:56,709
Do you remember his name?

644
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:02,209
So...

645
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,751
could he be the one
who said 'Yes'?

646
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:08,459
Then I should've been happy, right?

647
00:34:08,584 --> 00:34:09,834
I didn't have to die!

648
00:34:15,876 --> 00:34:16,876
Hello, sir.

649
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:19,125
Your friend has upgraded
you to an XL seat.

650
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:21,751
You can shift there
and sit more comfortably.

651
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:23,083
Thank you, sir.

652
00:34:26,209 --> 00:34:27,209
Come.

653
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:32,209
Go on.

654
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,792
Won't this run?

655
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:01,167
It ran out of charge.

656
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:06,417
Uncle, you must've received an OTP.

657
00:35:06,459 --> 00:35:07,792
Who are you calling "Uncle"?

658
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:08,918
Oh... sorry, bro.

659
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:10,918
An OTP must have come.
Could you tell me?

660
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:12,959
I've been sitting here for an hour.

661
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,375
I haven't seen anyone.

662
00:35:14,417 --> 00:35:15,709
Prabhendu N. Namboothiri?

663
00:35:15,751 --> 00:35:17,375
- Don't you have his number?
- I do.

664
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:18,626
Then just call and ask him.

665
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:19,667
Okay.

666
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,959
I thought you didn't believe
in ghosts and stuff.

667
00:35:29,042 --> 00:35:31,417
- I don't believe in them, but I'm scared.
- Oh!

668
00:35:31,459 --> 00:35:33,125
Aren't your mantras strong, sir?

669
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:35,918
Absolutely! A mantra saves
the one who chants it.

670
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,542
What was that line, Indu?

671
00:35:37,584 --> 00:35:39,918
- A lie?
- Not a lie! A line!

672
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:43,042
Ah, it's
"Manana thraayathe ithi mantrah"

673
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,250
A doll!

674
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:50,042
Take the sacred ash.

675
00:35:56,876 --> 00:35:58,584
Clean.
Let's go, let's go.

676
00:35:58,626 --> 00:36:00,542
Wait, there's a guest room too.

677
00:36:00,584 --> 00:36:02,459
- That's not really necess--
- Come on!

678
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,751
Clean!
Can we go now?

679
00:36:11,792 --> 00:36:14,209
Close the window, Sashiyetta.
We don't want pigeons getting in.

680
00:36:14,709 --> 00:36:16,417
Sir, next is the grandmother's room.

681
00:36:16,459 --> 00:36:17,834
That's the main one.

682
00:36:20,626 --> 00:36:21,626
You're not scared?

683
00:36:22,584 --> 00:36:23,667
Of what?

684
00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:25,751
You know plenty of mantras, right?
Chant them.

685
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:27,626
[chanting]

686
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:28,667
Come.

687
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,500
You too.

688
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:32,876
Who is he talking to?!

689
00:36:36,417 --> 00:36:37,876
This is the grandmother's room.

690
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:42,876
After what happened,
not even the staff will enter here.

691
00:36:44,751 --> 00:36:46,709
- She'd be in here all the time.
- Even now?

692
00:36:46,751 --> 00:36:48,459
No, I mean before she died.

693
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,500
Okay.

694
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:51,876
She hardly slept.

695
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,542
Why are you telling me all this?

696
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:56,083
She really loved the balcony.

697
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:57,417
Why? Was she a smoker?

698
00:36:57,459 --> 00:36:58,918
No, no.
To enjoy the breeze.

699
00:36:59,792 --> 00:37:01,000
Shall we cleanse that area too?

700
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:02,792
Yeah! The balcony's safe.
There will be sunlight.

701
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:03,959
Open it! Open it!

702
00:37:16,584 --> 00:37:17,751
Prabha!

703
00:37:19,292 --> 00:37:20,292
What is it?

704
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:22,042
There...

705
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:24,083
Where?

706
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:26,250
- It's...
- What?

707
00:37:26,876 --> 00:37:27,918
What?

708
00:37:44,584 --> 00:37:45,751
What is it?

709
00:37:45,918 --> 00:37:47,209
Don't kill us, sir!

710
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,334
We're not thieves, sir.

711
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:51,459
We were staying here
since it's an empty room.

712
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,876
- What?
- Is this the grandma?

713
00:37:54,876 --> 00:37:55,918
Get out, you!

714
00:37:56,334 --> 00:37:57,918
[panicked muttering]

715
00:37:58,125 --> 00:37:59,209
Oh no!

716
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,918
Don't call the police, Chetta!

717
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:02,918
Is the spirit gone?

718
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:04,125
Yes!

719
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:05,167
Clean!

720
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:14,709
[indistinct chatter]

721
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:18,209
Hey, did you decide to stop doing pujas
because of what happened today?

722
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:20,334
Not all all!
Today's puja worked, right?

723
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:21,959
We got rid of the spirit,
didn't we?

724
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,959
It's just that...

725
00:38:25,209 --> 00:38:27,000
The thought of you not
being here with me anymore…

726
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:28,709
I'll be in Bombay from next week...

727
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:30,375
busy with stage shows
and practice sessions.

728
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:33,500
I can't commit to pujas
in the middle of all that.

729
00:38:33,876 --> 00:38:35,250
It'll be a hassle for you too.

730
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:37,959
Hey!

731
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:40,083
Just leave the sacred
thread on for now.

732
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:41,375
Drop by when you're free.

733
00:38:42,042 --> 00:38:43,542
I don't feel as scared
when you're with me.

734
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:45,667
Here, take this.

735
00:38:46,918 --> 00:38:47,918
It's 50K.

736
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,125
50K? Wasn't our deal 60-40?

737
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:51,167
You take the whole thing.

738
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,751
Consider it your
provident fund!

739
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:55,959
Also, if you get any puja work
in Bombay, don't say no.

740
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,459
I've never been on a flight.

741
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,709
Get up! Let's go!

742
00:39:02,334 --> 00:39:03,334
What?

743
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:06,876
Huh!

744
00:39:07,626 --> 00:39:08,626
Hmm?

745
00:39:08,918 --> 00:39:09,918
What?

746
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:13,918
- Oh no!
- What is it?

747
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:14,876
- Snake?
- A snake?

748
00:39:14,918 --> 00:39:16,375
Get inside!
It's not safe, not safe!

749
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:17,417
Let's go.

750
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:22,542
Wow! Such a brave ghost!

751
00:39:26,751 --> 00:39:29,417
One, two...
Three and four...

752
00:39:29,459 --> 00:39:30,667
Guys, guys, guys!

753
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:33,000
I have to give the final count
for food tomorrow.

754
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:34,375
- Is anyone else coming?
- Yes.

755
00:39:34,918 --> 00:39:35,959
There's one more person.

756
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,125
Veg.

757
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:40,667
Hi, Prabhendu...

758
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:43,626
Shall I book our tickets to Bombay
together for next week?

759
00:39:43,876 --> 00:39:46,542
With you on the flight,
I barely noticed we'd reached Kochi.

760
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:47,834
Thanks for the company.

761
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:50,375
There's one more.

762
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:51,417
Play, play, play!

763
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:55,167
Tomorrow evening is my
cousin's pre-wedding party.

764
00:39:55,417 --> 00:39:58,417
Just reminding you, since you said
you might come if you're free.

765
00:39:58,459 --> 00:39:59,667
I've sent the location.

766
00:40:00,626 --> 00:40:02,459
What? Pookie Prabha
is feeling shy?

767
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,500
Why don't we go?

768
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:04,959
No, no, no.

769
00:40:05,209 --> 00:40:07,375
You've got to play a little hard
to get, to be taken seriously.

770
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:08,876
Ugh!

771
00:40:08,918 --> 00:40:10,459
When someone's being this frank,

772
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,959
don't put on
these stupid airs, okay?

773
00:40:12,751 --> 00:40:14,083
I'm not putting on airs, Delulu.

774
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:16,792
I just feel weird when someone
gets close to me too quickly.

775
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:20,250
See… she just met us…
No, actually… sorry… met you.

776
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:23,334
Did she really have to tell you
her whole break-up story right away?

777
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:24,250
No.

778
00:40:24,292 --> 00:40:25,292
I think she's into you.

779
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:27,542
No! It's…

780
00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:30,209
Maybe it's just because
she cried in front of us.

781
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:32,876
Not just that!

782
00:40:32,918 --> 00:40:36,083
Any other guy would have
used this chance to make a move.

783
00:40:36,584 --> 00:40:39,167
And... don't think I'm saying this
to flatter you. But...

784
00:40:40,626 --> 00:40:42,209
I think you are actually a nice guy.

785
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,292
Really?

786
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:44,834
Yeah!

787
00:40:47,626 --> 00:40:50,000
In that case,
if I ask you something...

788
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:52,709
will you tell me the truth?

789
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:54,876
This is such a classic guy move!

790
00:40:54,918 --> 00:40:57,876
When you're circling around for parking
and spot someone leaving a good space,

791
00:40:57,918 --> 00:40:59,209
you just swoop straight in!

792
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:01,042
Love-sick fools!

793
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,375
Love?

794
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,626
And me?

795
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,125
Music is my only love!

796
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:17,167
Oh, spare me the drama!

797
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:18,584
Just leave music out of this.

798
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:21,459
And it's always the single guys
who are the most romantic!

799
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,542
Ugh!

800
00:41:22,584 --> 00:41:23,876
What do you mean, "Ugh"?

801
00:41:23,918 --> 00:41:25,042
Come here, Prabha.

802
00:41:25,834 --> 00:41:27,250
Come here.
Sit down.

803
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,542
Prabha, a good relationship
just makes life better.

804
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:38,334
See... Someone who can understand
what's in your mind with a single glance...

805
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:42,375
And someone who can understand
the meaning of your silences.

806
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,876
Wouldn't it be great
to have that kind of support?

807
00:41:47,209 --> 00:41:49,459
You're absolutely hell-bent on
making me park there, aren't you?

808
00:41:50,042 --> 00:41:52,167
- Look, afterwards--
- That's not it.

809
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:55,542
Look, you'll be seeing
her again anyway.

810
00:41:55,584 --> 00:41:57,125
So you'll have a good
friend in Mumbai.

811
00:41:57,167 --> 00:41:58,250
We should go, Prabha.

812
00:41:58,292 --> 00:41:59,292
It will be fun.

813
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:01,584
That place is on the outskirts.

814
00:42:01,626 --> 00:42:02,876
Going by bike could be risky.

815
00:42:03,751 --> 00:42:04,959
Why don't you take your dad's car?

816
00:42:05,918 --> 00:42:07,375
Nah, that's not a good idea.

817
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:09,334
Why so much ego, Prabha?

818
00:42:10,542 --> 00:42:12,250
It's not ego.
It's just--

819
00:42:13,709 --> 00:42:15,083
Is that Pappu?

820
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:16,125
Yes.

821
00:42:16,792 --> 00:42:18,250
How did he get in?

822
00:42:18,292 --> 00:42:19,292
No idea.

823
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:23,876
All done, Pappu.

824
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,709
If we don't let this wound heal,

825
00:42:26,751 --> 00:42:29,042
the doctor will have to operate
on you again, just like last time.

826
00:42:30,751 --> 00:42:32,000
Sleep now, okay?

827
00:42:32,042 --> 00:42:33,626
Just call me
if you need anything.

828
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:35,083
Dad is right here, okay?

829
00:42:41,918 --> 00:42:43,042
You haven't slept?

830
00:42:44,334 --> 00:42:45,334
No.

831
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:47,876
Pappu has a wound on him.

832
00:42:48,542 --> 00:42:49,626
If he remains outside,

833
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:52,083
flies will land on the wound,
and it'll end up getting infected.

834
00:42:53,459 --> 00:42:56,417
I feel at peace
when he's in here.

835
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,167
When did you start this?

836
00:43:24,918 --> 00:43:26,125
Two years ago.

837
00:43:26,167 --> 00:43:27,626
It used to be a big cylinder.

838
00:43:27,876 --> 00:43:29,209
Deepu brought this one.

839
00:43:29,584 --> 00:43:30,709
It's comfortable.

840
00:43:34,292 --> 00:43:36,792
Please put that spray bottle
in the cupboard.

841
00:43:37,626 --> 00:43:39,292
Pappu might chew on it.

842
00:43:51,792 --> 00:43:53,584
I haven't moved
any of your mom's belongings.

843
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:56,083
Thulasi washes them every week.

844
00:43:56,751 --> 00:43:58,209
I press them
and put them back.

845
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:11,834
When I open that cupboard,
I feel like Sujatha is here,

846
00:44:11,876 --> 00:44:13,334
even if just for a little while.

847
00:44:13,876 --> 00:44:15,500
It gives me strength.

848
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:28,667
You can go to bed, Indu.

849
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:30,626
We are okay.

850
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:49,083
Dad...

851
00:44:54,626 --> 00:44:55,751
Can I...

852
00:44:55,792 --> 00:44:57,042
take our car tomorrow?

853
00:45:35,626 --> 00:45:38,083
"I saw you on the floor
In the crowd but alone"

854
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:40,626
"The music in my heart
Rings the lub-dub tone"

855
00:45:40,667 --> 00:45:43,042
"Would you let me
sing my love?"

856
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:48,751
"I drifted through the night
You're the star in my sight"

857
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:51,417
"The beat makes it right
For me and you"

858
00:45:51,459 --> 00:45:53,626
"Would you let me
sing my love?"

859
00:45:56,542 --> 00:46:01,459
"My heartbeat feels true
Oh baby, looking at you"

860
00:46:07,584 --> 00:46:12,250
"The music slows down
My sweetheart, dancing with you"

861
00:46:17,959 --> 00:46:20,584
"As the new groom
arrives in splendid array"

862
00:46:20,626 --> 00:46:23,292
"The whole place suddenly
glows in a lovely way"

863
00:46:23,334 --> 00:46:25,834
"Like an ocean where
foaming waves lift and play"

864
00:46:25,876 --> 00:46:28,751
"In this canopy decked
with garlands and bells"

865
00:46:28,792 --> 00:46:31,250
"The colours now blossom
as beauty swells"

866
00:46:31,292 --> 00:46:33,834
"Never to separate again"

867
00:46:33,876 --> 00:46:36,584
"They must flow
through life's terrain"

868
00:46:36,626 --> 00:46:41,667
"With one shared mind under the sun,
together… forever… as one"

869
00:47:03,584 --> 00:47:06,167
"Smile and step where rhythms deploy,
ankle bells chiming in light convoy"

870
00:47:06,209 --> 00:47:08,500
"O sparrows looping
in ecstatic ploy"

871
00:47:08,542 --> 00:47:10,876
"Who is ready to dissolve
in that whirling joy?"

872
00:47:14,292 --> 00:47:16,876
"In eyes lit bright where feelings beam,
there flickers softly a tender gleam"

873
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:19,209
"There's a tiny rattle
of naughty dreams that tattle"

874
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:22,959
"Yet no words can capture
such a dream"

875
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:51,292
"Without saying anything
to each other aloud"

876
00:47:51,959 --> 00:47:56,792
"Through the sharpness of glances
their hearts have avowed"

877
00:47:56,876 --> 00:48:02,209
"Will not all that's written
on life's turning page"

878
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:07,250
"Blossom forth as moonlight
that will never age?"

879
00:48:07,292 --> 00:48:09,876
"Won't even their silence,
like a drifting cloud"

880
00:48:09,959 --> 00:48:15,209
"Melt into honeyed words,
soft-falling, unbowed?"

881
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:17,876
"The umbrella is unfurling,
its shelter well dealt"

882
00:48:17,918 --> 00:48:20,542
"And beneath its shade,
a calm is felt"

883
00:48:20,584 --> 00:48:23,209
"Weaving a love as vast
as the ocean we span"

884
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,834
"Won't you and I rise
together like dawn…"

885
00:48:25,876 --> 00:48:30,626
"Forever… as one?"

886
00:48:53,042 --> 00:48:55,584
"I saw you on the floor
In the crowd but alone"

887
00:48:55,626 --> 00:48:58,167
"The music in my heart
Rings the lub-dub tone"

888
00:48:58,209 --> 00:49:00,334
"Would you let me
sing my love?"

889
00:49:03,584 --> 00:49:06,167
"In eyes lit bright where feelings beam,
there flickers softly a tender gleam"

890
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:08,626
"There's a tiny rattle
of naughty dreams that tattle"

891
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:12,375
"Yet no words can capture
such a dream"

892
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,918
I need to tell you something, Prabha.

893
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,834
What is it?

894
00:49:48,417 --> 00:49:49,792
I like you, Prabha.

895
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:57,167
Well...

896
00:49:57,792 --> 00:49:59,209
I like you too, Delulu.

897
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:01,542
That's not what I meant.

898
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,042
I'm in love with you.

899
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,667
Thank you.

900
00:50:09,876 --> 00:50:10,959
I love you too.

901
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,375
When I am speaking so frankly
without any ego,

902
00:50:13,417 --> 00:50:14,959
why are you behaving like this?

903
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:17,959
When someone else showed up suddenly,
did I become nothing to you?

904
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:20,709
What's gotten into you, Delulu?

905
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:23,459
Weren't you the one who told me
to go meet Saadhya?

906
00:50:24,417 --> 00:50:26,834
You're the one who set us up,
even after I said no.

907
00:50:27,709 --> 00:50:29,292
Where did this love come from
all of a sudden,

908
00:50:29,334 --> 00:50:30,334
like flipping a switch?

909
00:50:30,918 --> 00:50:31,918
I don't know.

910
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,542
I don't know!

911
00:50:33,584 --> 00:50:36,667
I can't hide things from the people
I care about the most.

912
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:38,792
I won't have any peace of mind.

913
00:50:40,459 --> 00:50:41,918
And you're the only one I have!

914
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:43,751
I have no one else.

915
00:50:48,209 --> 00:50:49,417
This is...

916
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:52,042
This is just a kind
of possessiveness.

917
00:50:54,626 --> 00:50:55,876
You'll get over it.

918
00:51:00,626 --> 00:51:01,876
Also,

919
00:51:01,918 --> 00:51:03,500
even though you're a ghost,

920
00:51:03,542 --> 00:51:05,125
you're not old enough
to get married.

921
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,834
And I'm almost past that age.

922
00:51:06,876 --> 00:51:08,667
Prabha, stop calling me a "ghost"!

923
00:51:08,709 --> 00:51:10,334
I've told you this many times.

924
00:51:11,959 --> 00:51:13,209
Then what should I call you?

925
00:51:13,751 --> 00:51:15,250
You don't know your name.

926
00:51:15,292 --> 00:51:16,500
I can't even touch--

927
00:51:16,542 --> 00:51:18,334
Prabha, love is not physical!

928
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,209
People love each other
from great distances.

929
00:51:20,584 --> 00:51:22,834
People fall in love
even when they're much older.

930
00:51:22,876 --> 00:51:25,042
It's about the deep
emotional connect we share.

931
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,959
We have that between us.

932
00:51:30,584 --> 00:51:32,250
Can you honestly say
we don't have that?

933
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:38,042
That's not what I meant.

934
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:40,459
See...

935
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,876
I'm trying to be practical here.

936
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:44,083
When Saadhya hugged me today,

937
00:51:44,918 --> 00:51:46,500
I felt my heart fill up.

938
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:48,500
It's the first time I've ever felt
something like that.

939
00:51:50,876 --> 00:51:52,584
Today was the happiest
day of my life.

940
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:55,083
And you were the first person
I shared it with.

941
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:56,751
And now you've spoiled it!

942
00:51:56,792 --> 00:51:58,209
You're so selfish!

943
00:51:58,667 --> 00:52:00,459
You've changed so much, Prabha!

944
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,918
Your life has only gotten better
since I showed up, right?

945
00:52:03,292 --> 00:52:05,125
I'm the reason
you even met Saadhya!

946
00:52:05,876 --> 00:52:07,626
You are all the same!

947
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:08,834
All men are the same!

948
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:17,250
Answer the call.

949
00:52:31,167 --> 00:52:32,167
I'm sorry.

950
00:52:32,626 --> 00:52:33,626
Talk to her.

951
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,083
I need some privacy!

952
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:52,209
I'm the one who needs
salvation from you!

953
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,500
What the hell, man?

954
00:52:57,584 --> 00:52:59,500
Don't you have anything
better to do, you jerk?

955
00:54:10,209 --> 00:54:11,209
Annie...

956
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:14,083
Our daughter has something to tell you.

957
00:54:15,542 --> 00:54:16,626
I know what it is.

958
00:54:16,667 --> 00:54:17,667
Not happening, Vinod.

959
00:54:19,042 --> 00:54:20,042
Huh!

960
00:54:20,709 --> 00:54:22,250
She wants a new iPhone, right?

961
00:54:22,751 --> 00:54:24,584
She's making a habit of this.

962
00:54:24,626 --> 00:54:26,626
No, Mom.
It's not about an iPhone!

963
00:54:26,792 --> 00:54:29,167
- Then what?
- It's... well...

964
00:54:29,626 --> 00:54:30,751
Papa, just tell her!

965
00:54:30,792 --> 00:54:31,792
Mummy...

966
00:54:31,959 --> 00:54:34,042
Chechi wants to
dye her hair blue.

967
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:35,626
Not blue, Chacko!
Lavender!

968
00:54:35,709 --> 00:54:38,000
- Oh, so I have to say that too?
- Ugh!

969
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:40,209
Oh, Papa, just tell her
the main matter now!

970
00:54:40,459 --> 00:54:41,459
What is it?

971
00:54:41,751 --> 00:54:43,000
Well, Annie...

972
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:44,876
We're not just their parents.

973
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,500
We're their best friends too, right?

974
00:54:46,751 --> 00:54:48,000
Skip the intro.

975
00:54:48,042 --> 00:54:49,042
Get to the point.

976
00:54:49,542 --> 00:54:51,417
Our daughter likes someone.

977
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:54,334
Oh, it's that Joe from
Kottayam, isn't it?

978
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:56,751
The moment I saw his gaze,
I knew it.

979
00:54:56,792 --> 00:54:59,709
Eww! Joe and Aishu are already
in a relationship.

980
00:54:59,751 --> 00:55:01,334
Huh! Since when?

981
00:55:01,959 --> 00:55:02,959
Papa!

982
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:04,792
Okay. Straight to the point.

983
00:55:05,209 --> 00:55:06,834
It's someone she met in Bangalore.

984
00:55:06,876 --> 00:55:09,125
Not from college,
but through a mutual friend.

985
00:55:09,292 --> 00:55:11,334
I warned you before,

986
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:13,918
many guys will come after you,
so watch out.

987
00:55:13,959 --> 00:55:15,542
Annie, let me complete.

988
00:55:15,584 --> 00:55:17,792
She's the one
who's going to propose!

989
00:55:19,334 --> 00:55:20,334
Yes.

990
00:55:21,292 --> 00:55:23,459
See, we're the first ones
she's telling this to.

991
00:55:23,709 --> 00:55:25,083
I think we should appreciate that.

992
00:55:25,292 --> 00:55:26,918
Yeah, we should.

993
00:55:27,834 --> 00:55:29,250
He's coming tomorrow.

994
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:32,125
We'll just meet him, grab a coffee,
and head back.

995
00:55:32,209 --> 00:55:33,209
That's it.

996
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,876
Does he like you?

997
00:55:35,709 --> 00:55:37,626
He hasn't said so yet...

998
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:40,792
But I'm so sure... we have
a deep emotional connect.

999
00:55:41,667 --> 00:55:42,667
Show me his photo.

1000
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:44,959
See, Papa?
What did I say?

1001
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,250
This is the problem with Mummy.

1002
00:55:46,292 --> 00:55:47,709
She judges instantly by looks!

1003
00:55:48,292 --> 00:55:51,209
Ha! We're meeting him tomorrow,
aren't we, Annie?

1004
00:55:51,542 --> 00:55:53,334
What's the harm in
showing a picture?

1005
00:55:54,167 --> 00:55:55,834
You don't like beards, Mummy.

1006
00:55:55,918 --> 00:55:57,167
He has a beard.

1007
00:55:57,459 --> 00:55:58,459
Also...

1008
00:55:58,918 --> 00:55:59,918
He is a Hindu.

1009
00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:02,334
And he's a little older than me.

1010
00:56:02,542 --> 00:56:03,626
Jesus!

1011
00:56:03,667 --> 00:56:04,959
Hey, relax!

1012
00:56:05,209 --> 00:56:07,834
Her prediction is that you'll be
the first one to like him, Annie!

1013
00:56:08,918 --> 00:56:10,042
Let us go, Mummy.

1014
00:56:10,083 --> 00:56:11,292
Chechi will be happy.

1015
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:13,083
- "Us"? No way!
- Huh?

1016
00:56:13,334 --> 00:56:14,959
You've got school tomorrow morning!

1017
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:17,876
Your Papa and I
will meet him first.

1018
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,918
- Yeah! Yaay!!
- Success!

1019
00:56:24,167 --> 00:56:25,167
I'll show you, okay?

1020
00:56:25,209 --> 00:56:26,500
I'm sure you'll be happy.

1021
00:56:26,542 --> 00:56:27,542
Promise?

1022
00:56:27,834 --> 00:56:28,876
Promise.

1023
00:56:31,459 --> 00:56:33,959
You know Varkey, right?
He runs the coffee shop here.

1024
00:56:34,834 --> 00:56:37,375
His cold coffee is
already famous, Annie.

1025
00:56:40,292 --> 00:56:41,542
Where is he?

1026
00:56:41,584 --> 00:56:42,918
He's late.

1027
00:56:43,626 --> 00:56:45,167
He needs time to get here, Mummy.

1028
00:56:54,584 --> 00:56:55,584
What is it?

1029
00:57:02,959 --> 00:57:04,000
Dear...

1030
00:57:04,042 --> 00:57:05,042
Papa, one sec.

1031
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:12,667
He's not coming, right?

1032
00:57:13,834 --> 00:57:15,000
Yeah, he's not coming.

1033
00:57:15,042 --> 00:57:16,083
Are you happy now, Mummy?

1034
00:57:22,042 --> 00:57:23,042
Sorry, Papa.

1035
00:57:23,209 --> 00:57:24,417
I think he guessed it.

1036
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:27,834
He guessed
why I asked him to come.

1037
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:30,667
That's okay, dear.

1038
00:57:31,792 --> 00:57:32,792
It's alright.

1039
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:35,500
We shouldn't expect anything
from anyone.

1040
00:57:35,751 --> 00:57:38,459
Your generation generally has a hesitation
to become committed.

1041
00:57:39,042 --> 00:57:40,334
It's quite natural, dear.

1042
00:57:40,918 --> 00:57:43,584
How can you judge someone
you don't even know, Mummy?

1043
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:52,751
Papa, I think he is just confused.

1044
00:57:52,792 --> 00:57:54,459
Maybe it'll be fine
if I just talk to him.

1045
00:57:56,584 --> 00:57:57,584
Dear!

1046
00:57:58,042 --> 00:57:59,042
Dear!

1047
00:58:03,667 --> 00:58:05,959
Rakhi, please ask the Head Boy
to come to my office.

1048
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Good afternoon, Ma'am.

1049
00:58:13,334 --> 00:58:14,334
Good afternoon.

1050
00:58:14,375 --> 00:58:17,209
Jacob V. Manjooran from 8-C...
His sister had an accident.

1051
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:18,459
She's in critical condition.

1052
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,876
Avinash, I need you to go with him
to the hospital.

1053
00:58:20,918 --> 00:58:22,709
I'll have a staff member
go with you.

1054
00:58:22,751 --> 00:58:25,417
- Okay, Ma'am.
- Jacob's parents will be there.

1055
00:58:25,459 --> 00:58:27,167
Till then, make sure that he's fine.

1056
00:58:27,209 --> 00:58:28,209
Sure, Ma'am.

1057
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,709
She's in the ICU.
Third floor.

1058
00:59:10,542 --> 00:59:11,542
Papa...

1059
00:59:12,334 --> 00:59:13,584
Where is Chechi?

1060
00:59:34,334 --> 00:59:35,334
Chacko...

1061
00:59:36,125 --> 00:59:38,292
Do you know when your sister
was her happiest?

1062
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:42,876
When you were born,
on the floor right below us.

1063
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:49,375
To make your Chechi happy now,

1064
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:53,375
Papa needs your help
with something.

1065
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:57,751
The doctors are saying...

1066
00:59:58,417 --> 00:59:59,792
that your sister is gone.

1067
01:00:01,584 --> 01:00:02,918
Her brain is dead.

1068
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,542
To stop the machine support...

1069
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:12,000
and set her free...

1070
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,125
they need my permission.

1071
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:21,834
They need a... "Yes" from me.

1072
01:00:25,209 --> 01:00:26,250
But...

1073
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:30,500
unless... unless you also say "Yes"...

1074
01:00:32,667 --> 01:00:33,959
I won't say "Yes."

1075
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,959
If I say "Yes"...

1076
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:43,834
will Chechi be happy?

1077
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:46,167
Yes.

1078
01:00:50,042 --> 01:00:51,083
Promise?

1079
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,292
Promise.

1080
01:01:03,417 --> 01:01:04,417
Yes!

1081
01:01:40,667 --> 01:01:42,834
My Papa's name is
Vinod Mathew Manjooran.

1082
01:01:43,709 --> 01:01:45,125
We have a plantation.

1083
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,083
Magic Hills Plantation.

1084
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:48,125
It's in Kuttikkanam.

1085
01:01:48,751 --> 01:01:50,167
My Mummy's name is Annie.

1086
01:01:50,792 --> 01:01:52,417
Chacko's real name is Jacob.

1087
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:55,292
Same name as my grandfather.

1088
01:01:55,334 --> 01:01:56,709
What's your name?

1089
01:01:59,209 --> 01:02:00,209
Delulu.

1090
01:02:00,834 --> 01:02:02,417
That's just the name
we gave you, right?

1091
01:02:03,459 --> 01:02:04,792
What's your real name?

1092
01:02:06,292 --> 01:02:07,459
Delulu...

1093
01:02:08,876 --> 01:02:10,209
means delusion...

1094
01:02:12,334 --> 01:02:13,375
means Maya.

1095
01:02:15,709 --> 01:02:16,751
Maya Mathew.

1096
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:43,626
"Don't leave; don't make my eyes
turn to tears"

1097
01:02:46,334 --> 01:02:54,334
"Don't disappear and fill my heart
with painful spears"

1098
01:02:56,667 --> 01:03:02,334
"Wasn't it in your eyes
that I saw myself clearer"

1099
01:03:02,375 --> 01:03:06,876
"As though I stood
before a living mirror?"

1100
01:03:07,292 --> 01:03:10,292
"When I stood all alone
in silent plea"

1101
01:03:10,334 --> 01:03:16,918
"Didn't you arrive
and breathe life into me?"

1102
01:03:18,334 --> 01:03:20,918
"As I climbed the steps
where darkness spread"

1103
01:03:20,959 --> 01:03:23,626
"To sparkle and shine
in the path ahead"

1104
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:28,292
"You appeared as a star in golden frame,
you rose as a lamp with a steady flame"

1105
01:03:28,959 --> 01:03:31,584
"You flew from the sky
and landed with art"

1106
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:34,334
"Resting gently
on the branch of my heart"

1107
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:38,542
"O petal, O angel,
sweet counterpart"

1108
01:03:39,667 --> 01:03:44,000
"O magic unending,
eternally rare"

1109
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,751
"May you never
disappear anywhere"

1110
01:03:50,334 --> 01:03:54,000
"O magic unending,
eternally rare"

1111
01:03:55,709 --> 01:03:59,709
"May you never
disappear anywhere"

1112
01:04:01,042 --> 01:04:09,000
"Don't leave; don't make my eyes
turn to tears"

1113
01:04:11,709 --> 01:04:19,709
"Don't disappear and fill my heart
with painful spears"

1114
01:04:54,751 --> 01:04:59,083
"The memories simply soak
in the rain of sorrow's tears"

1115
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:04,918
"And in that rain your face appears,
whispering its stories to my ears"

1116
01:05:04,959 --> 01:05:09,626
"The summer of separation
scorches everything in sight"

1117
01:05:09,667 --> 01:05:14,792
"And in that heat, thoughts of you
smoulder like an ember bright"

1118
01:05:15,667 --> 01:05:20,959
"O smile that enfolds me
in wings of feathered gleam"

1119
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:24,959
"Do not fade like an unseen wind
lost in a dream"

1120
01:05:26,334 --> 01:05:28,918
"You flew from the sky
and landed with art"

1121
01:05:28,959 --> 01:05:31,626
"Resting gently
on the branch of my heart"

1122
01:05:31,667 --> 01:05:35,876
"O petal, O angel,
sweet counterpart"

1123
01:05:36,959 --> 01:05:41,292
"O magic unending,
eternally rare"

1124
01:05:42,375 --> 01:05:46,083
"May you never
disappear anywhere"

1125
01:05:47,709 --> 01:05:51,375
"O magic unending,
eternally rare"

1126
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,042
"May you never
disappear anywhere"

1127
01:06:00,334 --> 01:06:01,334
Indu...

1128
01:06:01,417 --> 01:06:04,042
Everything you said
could be your imagination,

1129
01:06:04,584 --> 01:06:05,792
or it could be true.

1130
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:09,167
I'd like to believe
that it's true.

1131
01:06:11,918 --> 01:06:15,584
Her parents haven't seen
the person she loved, till date.

1132
01:06:19,751 --> 01:06:21,959
A soul can find
peace and salvation

1133
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,834
only by freeing itself
from sorrow!

1134
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:47,292
Lakshmy, the guest room first.

1135
01:06:47,334 --> 01:06:48,375
Okay, Madam.

1136
01:06:49,209 --> 01:06:50,209
- Would this do?
- Yes.

1137
01:06:55,918 --> 01:06:56,918
Yes?

1138
01:06:57,167 --> 01:06:58,751
I'm a friend of Maya's.

1139
01:06:59,375 --> 01:07:01,167
I was in the area
and thought I'd drop by.

1140
01:07:02,334 --> 01:07:03,375
Oh.

1141
01:07:03,751 --> 01:07:04,751
Come in.

1142
01:07:12,918 --> 01:07:14,250
Maya always used to say...

1143
01:07:15,209 --> 01:07:17,083
that regardless of how much
you both fought,

1144
01:07:17,125 --> 01:07:19,083
when she was away,
the one she missed the most...

1145
01:07:20,125 --> 01:07:21,334
was her mom.

1146
01:07:21,834 --> 01:07:23,209
She's a big liar.

1147
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:25,751
She'd say the exact same thing
about her Papa.

1148
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,959
We still haven't been able
to accept that reality

1149
01:07:31,292 --> 01:07:34,167
So, we don't really...
miss her, as such.

1150
01:07:37,792 --> 01:07:40,167
Her Papa has turned
into a complete workaholic.

1151
01:07:40,209 --> 01:07:42,209
And Chacko keeps studying
all the time.

1152
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:43,834
He's even the class topper now.

1153
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:50,375
But there are two things
that really trouble me.

1154
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:53,334
I miss her whenever I open
the fridge in the kitchen.

1155
01:07:54,292 --> 01:07:56,334
She always used to walk over
and open the fridge,

1156
01:07:56,751 --> 01:07:58,167
ever since she was a little girl.

1157
01:08:00,542 --> 01:08:03,167
And then, when I see clothes
lying all over the bed.

1158
01:08:03,792 --> 01:08:06,500
No matter how many times I told her,
she always left her clothes on the bed.

1159
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:09,417
Clothes were her weakness.

1160
01:08:09,876 --> 01:08:12,417
She was always on her phone,
browsing for them.

1161
01:08:18,417 --> 01:08:20,083
Let me get you
something to drink.

1162
01:08:56,626 --> 01:08:58,417
"You don't like beards, Mummy."

1163
01:08:58,459 --> 01:08:59,876
"He has a beard."

1164
01:08:59,918 --> 01:09:00,918
"And..."

1165
01:09:01,417 --> 01:09:02,834
"He is a Hindu."

1166
01:09:02,876 --> 01:09:04,709
"And he's a little older than me."

1167
01:09:08,626 --> 01:09:10,083
What's your name?

1168
01:09:16,834 --> 01:09:17,834
Prabhendu.

1169
01:09:20,959 --> 01:09:23,709
You were the one she was in love with...
Isn't that right, Prabhendu?

1170
01:09:36,792 --> 01:09:37,792
Yes.

1171
01:12:20,042 --> 01:12:26,876
"When someone sat close to me at night,
like new-fallen rain in cool delight"

1172
01:12:26,918 --> 01:12:32,500
"My heart shifted, lighter than ever,
turning at once to a moonlit river"

1173
01:12:33,542 --> 01:12:37,042
"Slowly unfolding its wings
in tender delight"

1174
01:12:37,167 --> 01:12:40,584
"Weaving a chain of laughter
pure and bright"

1175
01:12:40,626 --> 01:12:46,209
"My mind fills up
on its own tonight"

1176
01:12:47,417 --> 01:12:53,042
"Come, let's go to distances
we've never seen"

1177
01:12:53,417 --> 01:12:59,417
"Becoming two lovely,
colourful clouds serene"

1178
01:12:59,459 --> 01:13:01,083
"In this new birth
where our paths convene"

1179
01:13:01,125 --> 01:13:06,876
"Let's find our shelter on a blossom
branch kissed by morning dew"

1180
01:13:06,918 --> 01:13:10,459
"Becoming the breath
that rises soft and true"

1181
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:14,542
"Till every painful memory
softens and bids adieu"

- Just keep it here.

- No need.
- We have pork with Chinese potatoes.

Then I'll remove the pork
and get him the Chinese potatoes.

Will this idiot go around
asking everyone the same thing?

68

We don't even have enough budget
for everyone's omelettes.

69

If budget was a problem,
you should've said it earlier.

You know, adding an omelette to
the dosa gives it a touch of luxury.

71
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,500
I mean the electric guitar here,
not the omelette!

72
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:38,876
Yeah, I asked them
the exact same thing.

73
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:41,250

sent a message.

pulled out at the last minute.

if we remove one person.

- And also...

for the best?

83
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:03,000

It's not like you come from
some poor household!

86

Wouldn't even a tiny bit of
your dad's and brother's puja income

87
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:13,042
be enough for you
to manage a full Europe tour?

88
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:15,125
Wasn't it your ego that made you
snap your sacred thread

89
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,751
and choose to live by cutting costs?

90
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,334
If someone loses faith
and becomes an atheist,

91
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,792
that's their personal choice.

92
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:23,667

That's confidence.

- I'm not finished.

94

To become a truly
passionate musician,

95
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,417
you have to sacrifice
a lot of things.

had played it safe,

and gone to a bank job,

98
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:37,375
would we have even half the songs
we performed on stage today?

99
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:40,042
Prabha, I wasn't trying
to argue with you.

100
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:43,626
What I actually wanted to talk about
was the passion you have.

104

But that only happens
once in a while, right?

105
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:58,083
Anyway, since your trip is cancelled,

106
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,459
you should attend your father's
70th birthday celebration.

107

Your elder brother called you
so many times, right?

108
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:03,709
No, that's not a good idea.

109
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:04,751
Look...

110
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,959
There's a proven trend of grumpy dads
becoming warm and loving

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,792
once they hit 70.

112
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:12,209

and stay there for some time.

113

Where do you keep
shoving all these eggs?

119
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:26,167
So now it's quail eggs
instead of chicken eggs?

120

Welcome back, Indu!

179
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:45,834
You know, if you press that
like this after peeing, it sprays water.

180
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:47,459
It doesn't even take a second.

181
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,959
Why do you have to make
the whole room stink?

182
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,125
We're already peeing
into water, aren't we?

183
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:54,125
So why flush more water in?

Aha! So uncle's favourite is here!

185
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:00,417
Indu, I need to leave right away
to catch my flight.

186
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,209
Go take a quick shower,
wear a nice mundu,

187
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,667

of things downstairs.

188

For the puja in Kenya, ebony twigs
are required for the sacred fire.

190
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,167
That's not easy
to get at the moment.

191
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:14,042
And we also need
to check in early.

192
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:15,500
Is there an alternative I can use?

193
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,792
- Isn't it for an auspicious occasion?
- Yes.

194
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:20,834
Then just use small twigs
from the Bael tree.

195

That's a relief!
We have Bael in stock.

Bring back a Kenyan beauty
for our chronic bachelor here.

Deepu Chettan bought
his assistant a car.

Deepu would've taken you along.

Had you stayed with Neelakandan,

207
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,334
you would've been the chief priest
of our family temple by now.

208
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:54,876
Well, it's all because
of the path you chose, isn't it?

209
00:11:56,626 --> 00:11:57,709
At least what I chose...

210
00:11:57,834 --> 00:11:59,626

00:17:57,918 --> 00:17:59,876
Chetta, that was awesome!

348
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,751
You elevated the song
to the next level.

349
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:03,083
It's all because of
the Goddess's grace!

350
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,542
- Right, chetta?
- Yes, yes.

351
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,751
Can I just GPay you?

352
00:18:10,918 --> 00:18:12,209
You don't have cash?

353
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,167
Err... Sanaletta...

354
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:16,292
We don't have cash.
It'll be credited to your account.

355
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:17,417
Don't worry.

356
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:18,459
Nice work.

357
00:18:19,709 --> 00:18:20,792
Psst... Psst!

358
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,709
I've told you so many times

359
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:27,792
not to call me for these
low-budget music albums.

360
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:29,209
Oh, I see!

361
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,000
You said I should call you
even for a ₹1000 job.

362
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:32,334
This one pays ₹2500.

363
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
- Then where is it?
- It'll come when it comes.

364
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:37,626
I barely have money
to get home, Faizal.

365
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:39,292
Don't get stressed, Prabha.

366
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:41,250
Money comes today,
goes tomorrow.

367
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:43,584
How can it go tomorrow
if it hasn't come today?!

368
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:45,918
You know the composer
Viraj Trivedi, right?

369
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,584
He's looking for new
electric guitarists from Kerala.

370
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:50,709
There's a new Malayali girl
in his management team.

371
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,834
That's where this came from.

372
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,667
Remember the session
you did for Justin?

373
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,375
I've already sent it to them!

374
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:59,292
All his movie and stage-show teams
are from Mumbai.

375
00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:00,334
Photo! Photo!

376
00:19:00,918 --> 00:19:02,584
But it's worth a shot, right?

377
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:05,167
- What?
- I said, we can try!

378
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:06,334
Okay.

379
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:09,792
Is this to check your oxygen level?

380
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:11,751
It's for credit card verification.

381
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,334
- Want one?
- No, no! It's too stressful!

382
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,667
You can withdraw up to
₹60,000 per month, sir.

383
00:19:17,042 --> 00:19:18,083
- Really?
- Yes.

384
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:19,667
Hell yeah!
Bro, get him one.

385
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,459
What do you do for a living, sir?

386
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,500
I'm a musician.

387
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:24,042
Oh, then you'll definitely be rejected.

388
00:19:24,292 --> 00:19:25,542
- Huh?!
- Sign here.

389
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:27,918
Sir, one photo.

390
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:29,918
Don't smile so much.

391
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,125
Bro!

392
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:38,751
You got ₹200?

393
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:40,751
I went to Ernakulam yesterday
and came back with nothing.

394
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:41,959
There's zero stock!

395
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:43,417
How would I have money?!

396
00:19:43,709 --> 00:19:45,375
Why don't you just ask your dad?

397
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,125
Me? Ask him?

398
00:19:47,584 --> 00:19:48,959
Not in this lifetime!

399
00:19:54,918 --> 00:19:55,959
What is it?

400
00:19:57,334 --> 00:19:58,334
Never mind, it's fine.

401
00:19:58,709 --> 00:19:59,709
Who is fine? Me?

402
00:20:00,584 --> 00:20:01,584
Well, not that...

403
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:04,459
If you have something to say,
just say it.

404
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Do you have change?

405
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:07,209
How much for?

406
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,751
For... errr... two hundred.

407
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,125
Will two hundreds work?

408
00:20:12,918 --> 00:20:14,500
A single 200 rupee note
is also fine.

409
00:20:14,751 --> 00:20:16,626
Then that isn't really
'change,' is it?

410
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:20,834
Why do you need it?

411
00:20:21,918 --> 00:20:23,250
Just to step out for a while.

412
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:25,167
Then why don't you just…
step out?

413
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,209
I was thinking
I'd get a tea as well.

414
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,250
Oh...

415
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,292
- One minute.
- Okay.

416
00:20:36,876 --> 00:20:38,334
You recognise us, don't you?

417
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:40,417
Of course!

418
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:42,918
I remember seeing your daughter
when she was very young.

419
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:43,959
She's grown up so much!

420
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:46,334
Oh no, she's just my neighbour.

421
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,626
When I told her
we were coming here,

422
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,417
she came along
to see your ancestral house.

423
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:50,959
Yeah, yeah.

424
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,125
Oh, sorry!

425
00:20:53,459 --> 00:20:54,876
You both have a son, right?

426
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,459
This is my brother.

427
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,959
My husband is in Qatar.

428
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,626
It's okay.
Don't worry.

429
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,375
Here you go.

430
00:21:06,918 --> 00:21:08,500
There's enough tea
for three cups.

431
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:10,834
Help yourself
whenever you want.

432
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:12,459
Okay?

433
00:21:14,334 --> 00:21:17,042
Back in our day, if Father knew
I drank tea from outside,

434
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,500
I'd get beaten instantly.

435
00:21:18,751 --> 00:21:21,083
Kids these days...

436
00:21:21,334 --> 00:21:22,459
they are just different.

437
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:25,584
That was funny!

438
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:28,334
Weren't you the first one
to gain fame here, Prahladan Namboothiri?

439
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,500
Even my father
started off as your assistant, right?

440
00:21:30,584 --> 00:21:31,584
So what?

441
00:21:31,918 --> 00:21:34,209
How do you put up with Dad's
attitude and still stay here?

442
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:36,500
Because I'm very fond of myself.

443
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,083

445

Someone who loves us dearly,
and takes good care of us.

446
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,250
Right?

447
00:21:45,918 --> 00:21:46,918
Yes.

448
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:48,584
Why can't I be that person?

449
00:21:48,918 --> 00:21:50,834
I love myself dearly.

450
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:52,626
And I take very good care of myself.

451
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:54,334
You don't care about anyone but yourself!

452
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:55,918
You have no idea what
I'm going through!

If you apply that ability,
wealth can be earned again.

- There's only Upma at home.

521
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,876
It's masala dosa here.
I'll be right back.

522
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:23,042
Oh dear...

523
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:24,834
Five, six...

524
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:26,584
6 x 5 = 36...
It's okay.

525
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,876
Move.

526
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:29,083
This looks good!

527
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,709
- Did you make this, Paulose?
- Yes.

528
00:26:30,918 --> 00:26:31,918
- Is it made of teak?
- Yes.

529
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,626
Paulose insists it's teak.

530
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:35,083
Then it must've cost a lot.

531
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:37,292
Anything Paulose builds
never comes cheap, right?

532
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:38,709
I just hope it's sturdy enough.

533
00:26:38,751 --> 00:26:40,751
It's sturdier than
the wig on your head.

534
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:42,918
Better hold on to it.
Don't let it fly away.

535
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:45,542
How many people can
sit on this, Paulose?

536
00:26:45,584 --> 00:26:48,667
It won't move an inch
even if the whole village sits on it.

537
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:50,459
Stop exaggerating, Paulose!

538
00:26:50,584 --> 00:26:51,959
Me? Exaggerating?

539
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:53,209
Please step aside, sir.

540
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:54,584
I'll prove it now!

541
00:26:54,626 --> 00:26:55,626
All of you, move aside.

542
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:56,959
Come here, son.

543
00:26:57,167 --> 00:26:58,167
You sit there.

544
00:26:58,375 --> 00:26:59,709
All you kids,
go and sit.

545
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,167
Go sit, Chechi.
Go on.

546
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:02,959
Come on, everyone.
Come and sit.

547
00:27:03,626 --> 00:27:05,334
- What? You want to sit, Priest?
- No, no.

548
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:06,876
Please sit.
It'll be an honour.

549
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:08,167
Move aside.
Let the priest sit.

550
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,542
- No, really...
- Go on, sit.

551
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:10,959
How about now?

552
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,125
Call your dad or mom,
whoever's around.

553
00:27:13,209 --> 00:27:14,417
Let them try swinging on it.

554
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:17,542
Psst...

555
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:18,667
Coming?

556
00:27:22,834 --> 00:27:24,542
Come here, big shot!

557
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:26,667
Give it a good push!

558
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:27,500
Oh my!

559
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:28,459
Oh no!

560
00:27:31,709 --> 00:27:33,292
Nothing to worry!

561
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:34,500
The swing is perfectly fine.

562
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:38,167
Go on, cry again.

563
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:40,626
Shush!

564
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:45,500
Move, move!

565
00:27:51,709 --> 00:27:52,709
Rupe!

566
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:57,834
Does it hurt, son?

567
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Not at all.

568
00:27:59,334 --> 00:28:02,250
The doctor said the MRI scan showed
nothing wrong with his head.

569
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,250
Such a waste of money!

570
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:05,751
At least the X-ray
was worth it.

571
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:07,500
It shows swelling at two spots
on his spine.

572
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:11,209
Luckily, with Indu around, all the
pujas you agreed to won't be cancelled.

573
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:12,292
- Yes.
- Hmm.

574
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,918
Now, if you both could step outside.

575
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:17,417
I need to talk to Indu in private.

576
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:18,667
Go on.

577
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:21,000
Go on, Mom!

578
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:22,584
Let's go.

579
00:28:24,542 --> 00:28:25,584
Indu

580
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,542
- Indu...
- Yeah?

581
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,626
Yes, I'm your cousin.

582
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:33,209
But now...

583
00:28:33,834 --> 00:28:34,876
Now what?

584
00:28:34,918 --> 00:28:37,125
Now I'm your employer too.

585
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:38,417
So what?

586
00:28:39,292 --> 00:28:42,125
You're fully capable
of doing pujas on your own now,

587
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:44,083
and making your own money.

588
00:28:44,584 --> 00:28:45,959
That makes me proud.

589
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:48,542
Look, I'm not planning
to do this forever.

590
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:50,667
I'll leave once
I'm financially stable.

591
00:28:50,751 --> 00:28:51,876
Sure, you can leave.

592
00:28:51,918 --> 00:28:53,542
That's not my point.

593
00:28:53,918 --> 00:28:56,417
From tomorrow, we split
whatever you earn from the pujas,

594
00:28:56,459 --> 00:28:57,834
fifty-fifty.

595
00:28:58,125 --> 00:28:58,959
Huh?!

596
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,042
But I'm the one
doing the puja!

597
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:01,876
And I'm the one
bringing in the clients, right?

598
00:29:01,918 --> 00:29:03,209
- Rupe!
- Listen, Indu...

599
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:06,626
When family and friends
turn into business partners,

600
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:09,292
having clarity about financial matters

601
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:10,959
can help prevent future conflicts.

602
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,292
There's no point
spoiling our relationship over it.

603
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,334
That's all I wanted to say.

604
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,459
- 60-40.
- Yeah, that's fine. Fine.

605
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,500
40 is fine, 40 is fine.

606
00:29:20,709 --> 00:29:21,792
You are happy, right?

607
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:50,209
"It clears up like the sky
in its vast renew"

608
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:54,959
"It fills like the ocean of milk
breaking through"

609
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:59,751
"Ascend the chariot of that wisdom
alive within you"

610
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:04,459
"And continue your journey,
steady and true"

611
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,042
"Every single battle
that comes our way"

612
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:13,417
"Let us face it with
blazing determination each day"

613
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:19,042
"On the stylus tip where thought arises,
what counts as truth, what slips as lies"

614
00:30:19,292 --> 00:30:23,959
"Don't worry about any of that today,
Just turn to yourself, be yourself your way"

615
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,751
"The crystal-clear star
in the heavens so bright"

616
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,167
"It's holding its solemn vigil
in worshipful light"

617
00:30:38,417 --> 00:30:40,500
"To the tune of the soft chant
in gentle sway"

618
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:42,959
"That blooms on the tongue's tip
in a blossoming way"

619
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:45,334
"Within the realm of fading memories
that drift like shade"

620
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:47,459
"The Vedas endure,
refusing to fade"

621
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:50,125
"Counting them one by one
as patterns shift"

622
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:52,792
"Habits change,
letting the unwanted drift"

623
00:31:01,334 --> 00:31:02,334
Prabha...
Just a minute.

624
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:03,542
- Almost done.
- Okay.

625
00:31:03,876 --> 00:31:04,876
Hey, Prabha...

626
00:31:05,042 --> 00:31:06,000
Faizal told me.

627
00:31:06,042 --> 00:31:07,042
Congrats!

628
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:08,834
Don't forget us
when you make it big in Bombay!

629
00:31:08,876 --> 00:31:10,334
Oh, come on!

630
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:14,834
Hey...

631
00:31:14,876 --> 00:31:17,500
I've sent you a
request on Instagram.

632
00:31:18,584 --> 00:31:19,959
I'm not very active on it.

633
00:31:20,042 --> 00:31:21,500
Well, you can just accept it
right now.

634
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,584
Oh... just a minute.

635
00:31:28,626 --> 00:31:29,626
Hey, Rupe...

636
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:31,167
Indu, where are you?

637
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:34,500
Remember I told you about
Viraj Trivedi, the Hindi music director?

638
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:36,751
He loved the track
I sent him.

639
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:39,250
He has called me to the studio
for a video call session.

640
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:41,334
Wow, congrats!
That's amazing!

641
00:31:41,626 --> 00:31:43,417
What are you doing
tomorrow evening?

642
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,792
I've got a Ganesha Puja
at Kadampuzha at dawn.

643
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:47,751
I thought I'd watch a movie
later in the evening.

644
00:31:47,792 --> 00:31:49,626
Ugh! That's a horrible movie!

645
00:31:49,834 --> 00:31:51,459
But I never told you
which movie it was!

646
00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:52,626
Oh, you didn't?

647
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:54,959
- He didn't!
- Yeah, you didn't.

648
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,042
Anyway, listen...

649
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:58,083
Can you handle
one more puja tomorrow?

650
00:31:58,459 --> 00:31:59,709
You can go after 6:00 PM.

651
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:01,500
The pay is huge!

652
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:04,459
The biggest one our astrologer
Krishnanunni has ever given us!

653
00:32:04,626 --> 00:32:05,667
What kind of puja?

654
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:08,042
A lawyer from Palakkad...

655
00:32:08,334 --> 00:32:10,876
His son who's a 12th grade student,
is said to be possessed.

656
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:13,083
He's been seeing and hearing things.

657
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:15,500
Rupe, I honestly don't know
anything about exorcisms.

658
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:17,083
Hey, I'll walk you through it.

659
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:21,417
I'll send you a PDF on WhatsApp
with updated chants and procedures.

660
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,834
Otherwise, it's the same
Sudarshana Homam setup.

661
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:26,292
Just add more fire and flowers
for extra punch.

662
00:32:28,292 --> 00:32:30,751
Sometimes I wonder why we named
you 'Rupe'. You're obsessed with money.

663
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:32,167
How is that my fault?

664
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,500
Hey... please!

665
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:35,042
Alright.

666
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,500
- And hey, don't forget... 60-40.

667
00:32:36,709 --> 00:32:37,709
Yeah, okay.

668
00:32:38,626 --> 00:32:39,667
Hey Prabha...

669
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,334
Sorry, man. Not today.

670
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,042
Viraj sir's manager just called.

671
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:45,334
He worked through the night
and is sleeping during the day.

672
00:32:46,542 --> 00:32:47,542
Okay.

673
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:50,042
That's fine.
Just keep me posted next time.

674
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:51,209
Okay?

675
00:32:51,584 --> 00:32:52,584
Okay.

676
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,250
So...

677
00:32:55,292 --> 00:32:57,375
Can you add my Insta ID now?

678
00:32:57,417 --> 00:32:58,417
Chokichosky.

679
00:32:58,459 --> 00:32:59,876
Chokay... I mean, okay.

680
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:02,959
[Straight from the heart]

681
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,417
If you're going for physiotherapy,
use the car.

682
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:08,334
Ha! It's such a struggle for me
to climb down into that low car

683
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:09,584
and then haul myself back up.

684
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:12,042
An auto rickshaw is far
more comfortable.

685
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:14,500
Don't you have a puja today?

686
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:15,584
Yes.

687
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:16,876
- Be careful.
- Okay.

688
00:33:17,834 --> 00:33:20,709
What, am I supposed
to drive it myself now?

689
00:33:24,459 --> 00:33:26,542
Hey, what's all this
you've been chopping off?

690
00:33:26,584 --> 00:33:27,792
Will you destroy all the plants?

691
00:33:27,834 --> 00:33:29,500
For the plants,
this is just like a haircut.

692
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:30,709
They might even
be enjoying it.

693
00:33:30,918 --> 00:33:32,334
I'm crazy about plants, you know.

694
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:33,375
Shall we go?

695
00:33:35,042 --> 00:33:36,042
Name?

696
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,876
Hibiscus rosa-sinensis.

697
00:33:38,918 --> 00:33:39,959
It's also called "China Rose".

698
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,959
Not that!
What's your name?

699
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,042
Oh!

700
00:33:43,209 --> 00:33:44,209
I'm Animon.

701
00:33:44,751 --> 00:33:46,626
- Ready to go?
- Yeah, let's go.

702
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,709
Feel free to take the car
when you go for your pujas.

703
00:33:54,209 --> 00:33:56,250
It's okay.
I'll just go in this auto.

704
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:07,709
What puja is happening
so late, sir?

705
00:34:07,751 --> 00:34:08,751
Is it for the Goddess?

706
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:10,500
No! It's an exorcism.

707
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:18,667
- Advocate Dileep?
- Yes.

708
00:34:18,709 --> 00:34:19,918
Rupesh had called.

709
00:34:20,876 --> 00:34:22,500
Need a hand with your supplies?

710
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:23,876
No, it's fine.
I have someone with--

711
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:29,417
I'll call the driver.

712
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:43,959
Can I keep this here?

713
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,083
Yes, please.

714
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,959
Just the grass mat is left, right?

715
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:49,042
Yes, that's it.

716
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,667
- You can bring the boy in 10 minutes.
- Okay.

717
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,250
Deepthi Chechi!

718
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:00,042
Here you go.

719
00:35:00,709 --> 00:35:02,083
It'll be ready in 10 minutes.

720
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:06,167
Alright.

721
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:14,459
Do you practice
at the District Court here?

722
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,876
Yes, for the past two months.

723
00:35:16,334 --> 00:35:18,125
- I'm from Kuttikkanam.
- I see.

724
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:22,542
Whose guitar is that?

725
00:35:22,709 --> 00:35:23,834
That's Kuttu's.

726
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:25,500
Ah... I mean, Avinash.

727
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:27,292
He plays really well.

728
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:30,417
He always says,
"I'm hungry, Latha Chechi."

729
00:35:30,459 --> 00:35:31,709
Now, he has zero appetite.

730
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,042
Oh.

731
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:35,459
Didn't you take him
to a doctor?

732
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,626
We did. There's a doctor
at NIMHANS.

733
00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:39,167
Dr. Raphael.
He's brilliant.

734
00:35:39,709 --> 00:35:40,834
We consulted him.

735
00:35:40,876 --> 00:35:42,125
Kuttu is on medication too.

736
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:45,709
But my wife insisted
on having this puja done.

737
00:35:45,918 --> 00:35:47,626
I don't really believe in any of this.

738
00:35:59,876 --> 00:36:00,876
You can sit.

739
00:36:01,834 --> 00:36:03,459
Kutta... Sit down, son.

740
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:08,209
Sit down.

741
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,083
You can sit with him, Ma'am.

742
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:11,417
That will make him
more comfortable.

743
00:36:12,459 --> 00:36:13,459
Sit down, son.

744
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:21,000
When did all this begin?

745
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:22,375
It's been about a week now.

746
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:25,626
One night, he walked into our room crying
and lay down beside us.

747
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:30,167
He says someone keeps approaching him,
trying to say something.

748
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:33,292
A man or a woman?

749
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:34,751
It's a young girl.

750
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,209
Now he needs me with him 24/7.

751
00:36:39,209 --> 00:36:40,584
Even when he goes
to the bathroom!

752
00:36:44,459 --> 00:36:45,500
Hello!

753
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:49,834
He makes no eye contact at all now.

754
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,626
I see.

755
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:57,709
We're about to begin the puja.

756
00:36:58,292 --> 00:37:00,459
The spiritual reading suggests
this is a case of possession.

757
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,876
Once this puja is complete,

758
00:37:02,918 --> 00:37:05,709
the spirit will leave his body
and merge with the supreme.

759
00:38:24,334 --> 00:38:25,334
Hi Latha Chechi...

760
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:27,125
Huh?

761
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:41,375
Kuttu! Oh, my son!

762
00:38:42,459 --> 00:38:43,918
Latha, are you seeing this?

763
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:45,459
It worked?

764
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,542
Dileepetta!

765
00:38:46,584 --> 00:38:48,042
That's not possible!

766
00:38:48,918 --> 00:38:51,626
- Look, our son!
- Hey, Kuttu! Are you okay?

767
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:52,709
Yeah, I am okay.

768
00:38:53,626 --> 00:38:54,626
Deepthi!

769
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,417
See? Didn't I tell you?

770
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,918
[internalized sacred echoes]

771
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:16,209
- Gho...
- Gho...

772
00:39:16,918 --> 00:39:17,918
Go on, say it.

773
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:19,834
You go ahead.

774
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,626
The ghost is definitely gone.

775
00:39:22,334 --> 00:39:24,709
All the chants I sent you
worked like a charm.

776
00:39:24,876 --> 00:39:27,209
Oh, come on! They had already
consulted a doctor.

777
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:30,125
I think the medicine
finally kicked in.

778
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:31,959
Oh...

779
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:37,626
Still, if that lawyer paid ₹1 lakh
instead of the ₹60,000 we asked…

780
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,459
- Indu...
- What?

781
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:42,375
Ever since you started wearing
the sacred thread and doing pujas,

782
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:44,792
don't you feel some
kind of divine presence?

783
00:39:45,918 --> 00:39:47,959
I see this as
a job I'm paid for.

784
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,375
So shouldn't I just be sincere,
stay disciplined,

785
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:53,125
and do the job I was hired for
as honestly as I can?

786
00:39:53,167 --> 00:39:55,542
- You should.
- That's what this 'presence' means to me.

787
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:56,667
Oh.

788
00:39:56,918 --> 00:39:57,918
I'm leaving.

789
00:39:57,959 --> 00:39:59,792
And I need a three-day break,
starting day after tomorrow.

790
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:00,834
Oh no, no, no!

791
00:40:00,918 --> 00:40:02,417
I've already scheduled
three pujas for you!

792
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:04,292
- Take your break after that.
- No! No way!

793
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,751
How about 60-40?

794
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:08,000
- 70-30.
- Okay.

795
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:13,876
Mom, give me your phone.

796
00:40:13,918 --> 00:40:15,459
She hasn't posted
any status update today!

797
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,500
Oh.

798
00:40:29,918 --> 00:40:30,959
Hello?

799
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,751
There are several types of
silver idols here for today's ritual.

800
00:40:34,292 --> 00:40:35,417
I've sent you the photos.

801
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:36,459
Which one should I get?

802
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:37,751
Oh, just a second.

803
00:40:44,459 --> 00:40:45,459
Get the smallest one.

804
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:47,083
Okay, okay.
I'll take this one.

805
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:50,876
By the way, who's that Chinese fellow
in your WhatsApp DP?

806
00:40:51,751 --> 00:40:52,751
Chinese fellow?

807
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:04,292
He's a Korean singer.

808
00:41:04,709 --> 00:41:06,000
Oh, I see.

809
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:08,250
For a moment, I thought
I'd called the wrong person.

810
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:09,876
- Alright then.
- Okay.

811
00:41:14,709 --> 00:41:15,751
Thank you.

812
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:17,083
Okay.

813
00:41:32,626 --> 00:41:33,626
Hello.

814
00:41:33,876 --> 00:41:35,083
You're Prabhendu, aren't you?

815
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,500
I'm Sreekuttan.

816
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,292
I used to be
Rupeshettan's assistant.

817
00:41:38,792 --> 00:41:39,792
Oh!

818
00:41:39,834 --> 00:41:41,459
Rupeshettan used
to talk about a cousin

819
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,834
who left home twelve years ago,

820
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:46,334
threw away his sacred thread, and has
been wandering around playing the guitar.

821
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:48,792
So that's you, huh?

822
00:41:49,709 --> 00:41:51,417
And on top of that, you're an atheist!

823
00:41:52,334 --> 00:41:53,500
Good heavens!

824
00:41:54,042 --> 00:41:55,375
Let's keep this between us.

825
00:41:57,292 --> 00:41:59,959
So what if I charge a little extra?

826
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:01,834
You're better off with me by your side.

827
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,542
Okay, right?

828
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:06,375
Yes, we're okay!

829
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:35,250
[indistinct chatter]

830
00:42:35,292 --> 00:42:36,626
Oh dear...
Come on

831
00:42:37,042 --> 00:42:38,417
What just happened?

832
00:42:38,834 --> 00:42:40,334
He must be hurt.
Move, move.

833
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:41,918
[indistinct chatter]

834
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,167
- Are you hurt?
- You're okay, right?

835
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:46,459
- Hello!
- Is he okay?

836
00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:51,167
Oh Goddess!

837
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:54,834
If I've done anything wrong
without meaning to,

838
00:42:55,459 --> 00:42:56,959
please forgive me, Priest.

839
00:42:58,751 --> 00:42:59,751
Let's go.

840
00:43:07,292 --> 00:43:08,584
Chechi, are you Prabhendu?

841
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:11,167
- Huh?
- I asked if you're Prabhendu.

842
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,083
- No. Why?
- I have a parcel for Prabhendu.

843
00:43:13,584 --> 00:43:15,083
- Give it to me.
- To you?

844
00:43:15,167 --> 00:43:17,125
- What's the problem?
- Go call Prabhendu Chechi.

845
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:18,417
I'll hand it over to her myself.

846
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,834
Not Chechi.
He's a Chettan.

847
00:43:20,334 --> 00:43:21,751
- Chettan?
- Yes.

848
00:43:22,459 --> 00:43:23,918
Alright. Go call him then.

849
00:43:24,167 --> 00:43:25,834
I'll make sure
the crows don't peck it.

850
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:27,792
Wait here.

851
00:43:29,751 --> 00:43:31,292
There's a parcel for you, Indutty.

852
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:34,375
For me?
What could it be?

853
00:43:36,792 --> 00:43:37,918
I haven't ordered anything!

854
00:43:37,959 --> 00:43:39,125
Maybe you've got the wrong address.

855
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:41,626
Prabhendu N. Namboothiri,
Mullasseri House.

856
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:42,709
That's you, right?

857
00:43:42,876 --> 00:43:44,083
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

858
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:49,125
But I don't even have your app
on my phone...

859
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,083
It's there, right?

860
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:52,626
You'll get an OTP.
Can you read it out?

861
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:56,209
- 6, 2, 0...
- 6, 2, 0...

862
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,250
- 4, 0, 9.
- 4, 0, 9.

863
00:43:58,417 --> 00:44:00,209
- Okay.
- Wait, what about the payment?

864
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:01,459
That's already done.

865
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:03,667
Payment was through credit card.

866
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,500
Credit card?
But I never added my credit card to--

867
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,751
So that's saved too?

868
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:10,667
This is clearly a mistake.

869
00:44:11,042 --> 00:44:11,959
Please return this.

870
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,334
I can't just take it back.

871
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:15,167
I need a return token
from the company.

872
00:44:15,292 --> 00:44:16,542
That'll take a couple of days.

873
00:44:17,042 --> 00:44:18,626
I swear, I didn't order this.

874
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:20,167
Sir, if you have a complaint,

875
00:44:20,209 --> 00:44:22,834
take your time
and call customer care.

876
00:44:22,876 --> 00:44:24,292
That's what they're there for, right?

877
00:44:32,959 --> 00:44:35,292
What's going on with your phone?
You've been glued to it for a while.

878
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,584
I'm just deleting some unnecessary apps
from my phone, Uncle.

879
00:44:41,375 --> 00:44:43,042
The WhatsApp photo keeps
changing on its own!

880
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:46,667
It's downloading apps on its own
and ordering clothes with my credit card!

881
00:44:47,292 --> 00:44:49,042
Must be some Chinese app.

882
00:44:50,959 --> 00:44:51,959
Did you lose any money?

883
00:44:52,417 --> 00:44:53,417
Yup.

884
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:55,375
I've requested a refund.

885
00:44:55,834 --> 00:44:56,834
Hopefully it comes through.

886
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:42,167
Hi!

887
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:47,959
Hey, don't panic.

888
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:51,459
I'll go and come back later.

889
00:45:55,334 --> 00:45:56,417
Bye!

890
00:46:47,667 --> 00:46:49,584
Why did you sleep here last night?

891
00:46:49,626 --> 00:46:51,083
What's with this sudden affection?

892
00:46:52,959 --> 00:46:54,709
I had a dream last night.

893
00:46:55,751 --> 00:46:56,751
It really shook me.

894
00:46:56,792 --> 00:46:57,918
Oh!

895
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,292
There was a girl...

896
00:47:01,042 --> 00:47:02,542
She was just sitting there, staring at me.

897
00:47:03,584 --> 00:47:04,876
A very beautiful girl.

898
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:08,250
That's a standard dream for bachelors
well past their marriage age.

899
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,500
Even at my age,
I get such dreams.

900
00:47:10,542 --> 00:47:11,542
So naturally, you would too!

901
00:47:12,334 --> 00:47:13,459
This wasn't like that.

902
00:47:13,959 --> 00:47:16,459
I even heard her voice clearly.

903
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,042
She said,
"I'll go and come back later."

904
00:47:19,167 --> 00:47:21,500
This is a 90-year-old
ancestral home, right?

905
00:47:21,667 --> 00:47:23,167
All sorts of things can show up here.

906
00:47:23,459 --> 00:47:24,459
Damn!

907
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,626
I've been available right next
door for all these years,

908
00:47:27,709 --> 00:47:30,250
and not a single one
ever came to see me!

909
00:47:30,834 --> 00:47:32,542
Nah, this one seems pretty modern.

910
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:34,709
She didn't even try to scare me.

911
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:36,876
She was just sitting there casually,
scrolling through my phone.

912
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:41,292
Next time you see her,
send her my way.

913
00:47:41,584 --> 00:47:43,000
At least I'll have some company.

914
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:48,667
Hey, call Paul and ask him
to send an auto rickshaw.

915
00:47:48,751 --> 00:47:50,667
I've got a meeting at ten.

916
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,542
Okay.

917
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:58,042
Hi!

918
00:47:58,876 --> 00:47:59,876
Good morning.

919
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,292
Please, come in.

920
00:48:02,209 --> 00:48:03,209
Come on in.

921
00:48:03,751 --> 00:48:05,292
Kuttoos had an Android phone, you know.

922
00:48:05,542 --> 00:48:07,584
I was never really
comfortable with Android.

923
00:48:07,834 --> 00:48:10,918
The fact that you have an iPhone
is such a relief, Prabha!

924
00:48:11,584 --> 00:48:12,959
Which 'Kuttoos'?

925
00:48:13,334 --> 00:48:15,042
Remember the puja you did that day?

926
00:48:15,334 --> 00:48:16,417
What was his real name again?

927
00:48:16,542 --> 00:48:17,918
Oh... Avinash!

928
00:48:17,959 --> 00:48:19,709
Gosh, he was such a cutie!

929
00:48:19,918 --> 00:48:21,167
But scared out of his mind.

930
00:48:21,334 --> 00:48:23,125
So scared,
he wouldn't even make eye contact!

931
00:48:23,751 --> 00:48:25,959
How are you supposed to talk to someone
who won't even look at you?

932
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:27,959
But you're very brave, Prabha.

933
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:29,542
You have good eye contact.

934
00:48:29,584 --> 00:48:31,083
I like it.
Ten on Ten!

935
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:33,584
But you did get scared yesterday.

936
00:48:33,626 --> 00:48:35,042
It's totally understandable.

937
00:48:35,083 --> 00:48:36,250
Anyone would have been scared.

938
00:48:36,292 --> 00:48:37,459
It was your first time, right?

939
00:48:38,626 --> 00:48:40,918
By the way, is it okay
if I call you Prabha?

940
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,626
Sure.

941
00:48:41,667 --> 00:48:44,083
I noticed your friends calling
you that in your chats.

942
00:48:45,042 --> 00:48:46,751
Also, it's such an interesting name.

943
00:48:47,292 --> 00:48:48,292
Prabhendu.

944
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:49,834
Super sweet.

945
00:48:50,209 --> 00:48:51,125
I like it.

946
00:48:51,167 --> 00:48:52,709
- I really like it.
- Indu!

947
00:48:53,125 --> 00:48:54,792
I need the auto rickshaw
only at 11 o'clock.

948
00:48:54,834 --> 00:48:56,250
I just read the notice.

949
00:48:56,959 --> 00:48:57,959
Okay!

950
00:49:02,459 --> 00:49:03,959
Alright, you can have
your phone back now.

951
00:49:04,042 --> 00:49:05,250
I don't need it again till the night.

952
00:49:23,584 --> 00:49:24,626
Anxiety?

953
00:49:27,042 --> 00:49:28,042
Bipolar?

954
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:30,125
No.

955
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,292
Then what on earth is it?

956
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,500
Huh?!

957
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:33,751
I was talking to her.

958
00:49:34,042 --> 00:49:35,042
It's not dry yet.

959
00:49:35,542 --> 00:49:36,959
Can you please call Doctor Raphael?

960
00:49:38,292 --> 00:49:39,709
That's me.
What's the matter?

961
00:49:40,042 --> 00:49:41,334
So… I'm a person who performs pujas.

962
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,042
Three days ago,
I went to a house for a puja.

963
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:44,959
- Not a house, actually a flat, for puja--
- Stop, Stop!

964
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,334
Could you please move, Chechi?

965
00:49:48,626 --> 00:49:50,375
- Continue.
- Like I said, I perform pujas.

966
00:49:50,417 --> 00:49:52,709
Three days ago,
I went to a flat for a puja.

967
00:49:52,834 --> 00:49:54,042
It was meant to drive out a spirit.

968
00:49:54,083 --> 00:49:57,584
His parents said they had
brought him to you, Doctor.

969
00:49:57,834 --> 00:49:59,542
Avinash.
He's slightly chubby…

970
00:49:59,584 --> 00:50:00,542
Oh, yes!

971
00:50:00,584 --> 00:50:02,500
Anyway, after the puja,
he recovered completely.

972
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:05,626
But now I'm experiencing
the same symptoms he had.

973
00:50:06,167 --> 00:50:08,292
I'm seeing the same girl
he said he used to see.

974
00:50:08,584 --> 00:50:11,667
I saw her last night,
and again today, in broad daylight.

975
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:13,959
I could hear her voice too.
Crystal clear.

976
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:15,083
Can you see her right now?

977
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:20,209
Not right now.

978
00:50:21,125 --> 00:50:22,167
And?

979
00:50:22,417 --> 00:50:23,417
Well, that's all.

980
00:50:23,542 --> 00:50:25,500
Also, the moment I saw that boy,
I understood what the issue was.

981
00:50:25,542 --> 00:50:28,167
Seeing people who aren't there,
hearing voices nobody else hears…

982
00:50:28,209 --> 00:50:29,250
Sheezo-phrenia!

983
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:30,292
Schizophrenia.

984
00:50:30,334 --> 00:50:32,626
I Googled it
and I have all the symptoms.

985
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:34,334
- You Googled it?
- Yeah.

986
00:50:34,834 --> 00:50:36,334
I'm willing to take any medication.

987
00:50:36,876 --> 00:50:39,167
Am I talking too fast right now?
Doctor, are you following me so far?

988
00:50:39,709 --> 00:50:41,626
Didn't you say you fixed
Avinash's problem with your puja?

989
00:50:41,667 --> 00:50:42,959
- Yes.
- Then similarly…

990
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:45,292
why not perform a puja
and cure your own condition?

991
00:50:46,459 --> 00:50:47,500
I...

992
00:50:47,626 --> 00:50:49,209
I don't believe in God, Doctor.

993
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,292
I'm...

994
00:50:50,334 --> 00:50:51,375
an atheist.

995
00:50:51,542 --> 00:50:52,334
Huh?!

996
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:54,709
Then how can you be doing pujas?

997
00:50:55,792 --> 00:50:57,042
Well...

998
00:50:57,083 --> 00:50:58,751
I'm basically a musician.

999
00:50:58,792 --> 00:51:01,167
A guitarist.
I'm on a short break right now.

1000
00:51:01,417 --> 00:51:03,959
I was trained in all these rituals
until I turned nineteen.

1001
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:06,292
When did you begin
losing faith in this "item"?

1002
00:51:06,792 --> 00:51:08,083
Which "item," Doctor?

1003
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,500
God.

1004
00:51:13,542 --> 00:51:14,751
Well... that...

1005
00:51:17,959 --> 00:51:19,125
Come with me.

1006
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:30,500
One day, it was just my mother
and me at home.

1007
00:51:31,375 --> 00:51:34,792
My brother, father, and uncle
had gone to Delhi for a puja.

1008
00:51:36,042 --> 00:51:40,292
Mom and I were watching
an A.R. Rahman concert on Doordarshan.

1009
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:42,876
Mom had Master's degree in Music.

1010
00:51:42,918 --> 00:51:44,167
She even played the veena.

1011
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:48,751
We have a shrine inside the house,
almost like a small temple.

1012
00:51:49,792 --> 00:51:51,918
When it was time
to do the puja there,

1013
00:51:51,959 --> 00:51:53,500
I purified myself and went inside.

1014
00:51:53,959 --> 00:51:55,167
We call it the 'Thevaram'.

1015
00:51:56,292 --> 00:51:58,167
Just as I lit the lamp
and began the Puja,

1016
00:51:58,584 --> 00:52:00,083
I heard my mother
calling out to me loudly.

1017
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,167
I ignored it.

1018
00:52:03,292 --> 00:52:04,792
I thought I would
finish the puja first.

1019
00:52:05,334 --> 00:52:06,834
When I went back,

1020
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:10,375
I saw my mom lying face down
on the floor, next to the sofa.

1021
00:52:11,834 --> 00:52:13,667
The moment I held her,
I knew she was gone.

1022
00:52:14,584 --> 00:52:15,876
It was a cardiac arrest.

1023
00:52:19,751 --> 00:52:21,876
I held my mom in my lap
and stared right at the lamp,

1024
00:52:22,292 --> 00:52:24,209
still burning after the puja.

1025
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:27,167
I could see it clearly
from where I was.

1026
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:29,667
That day,

1027
00:52:29,834 --> 00:52:31,626
more than sadness,
what I felt was anger.

1028
00:52:33,542 --> 00:52:34,751
In that moment,

1029
00:52:35,834 --> 00:52:37,626
I lost my connection with God.

1030
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:39,918
Man, this is your real issue!

1031
00:52:40,751 --> 00:52:42,292
You have deep-seated trauma.

1032
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:43,792
No way.

1033
00:52:43,834 --> 00:52:45,667
Those two things
have nothing to do with each other.

1034
00:52:45,959 --> 00:52:48,667
Whether they're connected or not,
let's deal with this trauma first.

1035
00:52:49,709 --> 00:52:51,125
What if that girl
shows up again?

1036
00:52:51,417 --> 00:52:52,417
Let her show up.

1037
00:52:52,626 --> 00:52:54,125
She'll go away
the same way she appeared.

1038
00:52:54,375 --> 00:52:55,667
I'll give you a simple fix for that.

1039
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,125
There's a tablet
that contains melatonin.

1040
00:52:58,167 --> 00:52:59,334
It's not a sleeping pill.

1041
00:52:59,667 --> 00:53:01,209
Just take it
before you go to bed.

1042
00:53:01,417 --> 00:53:02,500
You will get a good sleep.

1043
00:53:02,542 --> 00:53:03,500
Huh?

1044
00:53:03,542 --> 00:53:04,959
Don't I need any other medicine?

1045
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,751
There's no better medicine in the world
than a good night's sleep.

1046
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:09,542
Trust me.
You're fine.

1047
00:53:51,459 --> 00:53:52,459
Okay.

1048
00:53:56,459 --> 00:53:57,542
Okay.

1049
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:09,375
You are okay!

1050
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:15,375
You are okay!

1051
00:55:12,584 --> 00:55:13,626
Hi!

1052
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:17,250
I didn't want to wake you up,
so I just came and sat here quietly.

1053
00:55:17,709 --> 00:55:19,209
Anyway, I'm glad
I saw you today.

1054
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:21,292
Why should we keep
startling each other like this?

1055
00:55:21,459 --> 00:55:22,959
We're well past that stage now,
aren't we?

1056
00:55:27,042 --> 00:55:28,209
Whoa! Relax.

1057
00:55:28,584 --> 00:55:30,042
This isn't a dream.

1058
00:55:30,709 --> 00:55:32,375
Look, the time is 1:40 AM.

1059
00:55:32,459 --> 00:55:34,667
Uncle just went to the wash room
and got back in bed.

1060
00:55:34,709 --> 00:55:36,334
As usual, he didn't flush.

1061
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:37,542
Shall I flush it for him?

1062
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:38,626
I can do it from here.

1063
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:47,292
Shall I turn on the light?

1064
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:52,542
Sorry, I'm just figuring this out.

1065
00:55:53,209 --> 00:55:54,584
You just need to change the bulb.

1066
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:55,918
Indu!

1067
00:55:58,083 --> 00:55:59,334
I think he got up.

1068
00:55:59,792 --> 00:56:01,709
Tell you what.
You go back to sleep.

1069
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,167
You've taken the medicine, right?

1070
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:06,250
And if you don't mind,
I need to check some stuff on this.

1071
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:07,667
I'll return it in the morning.

1072
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:13,918
What was that sound?

1073
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:18,000
Oh! He can't see me.

1074
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,876
Your uncle can't see me.

1075
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:22,250
Oh!

1076
00:56:22,542 --> 00:56:23,542
What do you mean, 'Oh'?

1077
00:56:23,918 --> 00:56:25,292
I asked what that sound was.

1078
00:56:25,417 --> 00:56:26,417
Oh, that...

1079
00:56:26,876 --> 00:56:28,709
I think the bulb blew
from a voltage surge.

1080
00:56:28,751 --> 00:56:29,918
My dear Indu,

1081
00:56:29,959 --> 00:56:31,959
just say your prayers
and go to sleep.

1082
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:35,083
No faith in God,
but scared out of your wits!

1083
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,500
Ugh!

1084
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:43,542
Go back to sleep, Prabha.

1085
00:56:43,792 --> 00:56:45,000
I'm okay out here.

1086
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:48,500
By the way, good call on placing
the return request for the kurta.

1087
00:56:48,542 --> 00:56:50,375
I ordered the white kurta
with lavender accents.

1088
00:56:50,417 --> 00:56:52,542
But I think they sent
white with pink instead.

1089
00:56:52,918 --> 00:56:55,959
Anyway, I've scheduled
the pickup for tomorrow.

1090
00:56:56,125 --> 00:56:57,375
Just make sure
you hand it over.

1091
00:57:04,959 --> 00:57:06,500
Is there something
you want to ask me?

1092
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:11,500
Finally!
Go on, ask me.

1093
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Who... are you?

1094
00:57:20,209 --> 00:57:21,667
I hate to say this.

1095
00:57:23,125 --> 00:57:25,083
But I think I'm a ghost.

1096
00:57:26,083 --> 00:57:28,375
Yeah, I think so.

1097
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:51,167
Pradeep...

1098
00:57:51,209 --> 00:57:53,375
July 12th and 13th
are auspicious days.

1099
00:57:53,667 --> 00:57:54,667
Plan it accordingly.

1100
00:57:54,792 --> 00:57:55,792
Okay?

1101
00:57:57,167 --> 00:57:58,542
What are you doing here
at this hour?

1102
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:01,417
What's in the bag?

1103
00:58:04,542 --> 00:58:05,751
Psst... psst!

1104
00:58:05,918 --> 00:58:07,667
Don't! Don't!
[chants slokas]

1105
00:58:07,709 --> 00:58:08,918
Psst... psst!
Over here!

1106
00:58:10,417 --> 00:58:11,417
Where did you see it?

1107
00:58:11,542 --> 00:58:12,626
In my room.

1108
00:58:12,918 --> 00:58:14,042
- It's still here.
- Still there?

1109
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:15,542
Why didn't you tell me
this when you called?

1110
00:58:15,709 --> 00:58:17,459
- But my phone is with her!
- Oh.

1111
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,500
Come on.

1112
00:58:19,876 --> 00:58:21,083
Will she hurt me?

1113
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:24,500
- I don't think so.
- You don't "think" so?

1114
00:58:25,209 --> 00:58:26,542
Why is this door locked?

1115
00:58:26,918 --> 00:58:28,500
So she can't get out.

1116
00:58:28,709 --> 00:58:29,709
Oh.

1117
00:58:29,876 --> 00:58:30,918
The ghost? Seriously?

1118
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:33,417
Open it.

1119
00:58:36,959 --> 00:58:38,459
And that?
Open that too!

1120
00:58:40,792 --> 00:58:41,834
She's gone!

1121
00:58:43,167 --> 00:58:44,751
Didn't I tell you, Indu?

1122
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,834
It's just your mind playing tricks.

1123
00:58:47,876 --> 00:58:51,125
The rest will sort itself
out after the puja.

1124
00:58:51,167 --> 00:58:52,375
You know who's doing it, right?

1125
00:58:53,834 --> 00:58:55,083
East should be this side, right?

1126
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:57,375
- That side.
- Right.

1127
00:58:58,751 --> 00:59:00,292
No, I'll handle this.

1128
00:59:00,334 --> 00:59:01,292
Right now, you're the client.

1129
00:59:01,334 --> 00:59:02,417
- You've got a lamp?
- Yes.

1130
00:59:02,459 --> 00:59:03,751
Bring it here.
I need to light it.

1131
00:59:03,792 --> 00:59:04,792
I'll handle that as well.

1132
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:08,751
Once you conquer fear,
the battle is half-won...

1133
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:10,459
Hey! Where are you off to?

1134
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:12,167
You asked me to bring the lamp.

1135
00:59:12,209 --> 00:59:13,667
Don't go alone.
I'll come with you.

1136
00:59:20,751 --> 00:59:23,000
Oil, coconut, matches…
Take everything at once.

1137
00:59:23,042 --> 00:59:25,000
Don't keep going in and
out while I'm inside.

1138
00:59:25,042 --> 00:59:26,083
It isn't safe.

1139
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:27,626
What are you staring at?
Let's go!

1140
00:59:29,209 --> 00:59:30,751
My god, I've never
seen anyone so scared!

1141
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:34,626
Phew! Safe!

1142
00:59:40,626 --> 00:59:43,417
Uncle, I've come to collect
a parcel for return.

1143
00:59:43,709 --> 00:59:44,792
What parcel?

1144
00:59:44,959 --> 00:59:46,167
It's a kurta set.

1145
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:48,500
But nobody in this
house wears kurtas.

1146
00:59:48,542 --> 00:59:49,959
This one is a ladies' kurta.

1147
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,083
Prabhendu must be your son, right?

1148
00:59:52,459 --> 00:59:54,167
- Yes.
- Ah, he ordered it.

1149
00:59:55,375 --> 00:59:56,459
- Here you go.
- Right!

1150
00:59:57,167 --> 00:59:58,626
Indutty gave it to
me in the morning.

1151
00:59:59,918 --> 01:00:01,709
Valentine's Day is
around the corner, right?

1152
01:00:01,751 --> 01:00:03,334
Must be a gift for someone special.

1153
01:00:03,459 --> 01:00:04,792
Oh dear, this Indutty!

1154
01:00:13,834 --> 01:00:14,834
Phew!

1155
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:16,876
I'm not just saying this
because I did it...

1156
01:00:16,918 --> 01:00:18,626
- What?
- The puja was a big success.

1157
01:00:18,709 --> 01:00:19,709
Hmm.

1158
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,375
That thing you spoke about…

1159
01:00:21,459 --> 01:00:22,459
She's a real terror.

1160
01:00:22,667 --> 01:00:24,375
I watched her leave
with my own eyes!

1161
01:00:26,083 --> 01:00:27,083
Hmm.

1162
01:00:28,042 --> 01:00:30,167
I'm thinking maybe
I should see that doctor again.

1163
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:31,375
Come on!
What for?

1164
01:00:31,417 --> 01:00:32,626
This is a form of treatment too.

1165
01:00:32,667 --> 01:00:35,626
This time, I decided to add
a touch of extra sorcery,

1166
01:00:35,751 --> 01:00:36,751
just for flavour.

1167
01:00:36,792 --> 01:00:37,792
And it worked perfectly.

1168
01:00:39,709 --> 01:00:40,751
Why do you look so unconvinced?

1169
01:00:40,792 --> 01:00:42,083
No, I'm not doubting anything.

1170
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:43,626
Alright then! Get up.

1171
01:00:43,959 --> 01:00:44,959
Oh my...

1172
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:46,918
Let me know once you're
done being scared.

1173
01:00:47,667 --> 01:00:49,209
There are a few pending pujas.

1174
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,500
Let's wrap those up too.

1175
01:00:51,167 --> 01:00:52,250
Alright then, I'll get going.

1176
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,751
- Okay.
- I forgot something.

1177
01:00:53,834 --> 01:00:56,542
Your father is upset that you
don't visit the temple anymore.

1178
01:00:56,834 --> 01:00:57,959
At least go once in a while.

1179
01:00:58,042 --> 01:00:59,000
Poor soul.

1180
01:00:59,042 --> 01:01:00,042
What are you thinking?

1181
01:01:00,375 --> 01:01:01,292
That item?

1182
01:01:01,334 --> 01:01:02,417
She's gone!

1183
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:03,959
Chill! Okay?

1184
01:01:04,584 --> 01:01:06,417
Let me see how she
dares to return now!

1185
01:01:06,584 --> 01:01:07,584
Okay.

1186
01:01:09,584 --> 01:01:10,500
Huh!

1187
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:11,626
Done getting shocked?

1188
01:01:14,292 --> 01:01:15,292
Who's he calling an "item"?

1189
01:01:15,334 --> 01:01:16,334
Do I look like an item?

1190
01:01:32,292 --> 01:01:33,667
Don't go without talking to me.

1191
01:01:33,751 --> 01:01:35,834
If you keep running away,
that's all you'll ever do.

1192
01:01:37,042 --> 01:01:40,500
Listen... have I done anything to you
like those horror-movie ghosts?

1193
01:01:42,834 --> 01:01:43,834
Yes or no?

1194
01:01:45,417 --> 01:01:46,417
No.

1195
01:01:46,542 --> 01:01:48,250
Other than you getting
shocked seeing me

1196
01:01:48,292 --> 01:01:49,709
and me getting shocked
seeing you,

1197
01:01:49,751 --> 01:01:51,459
have I troubled you in any way?

1198
01:01:53,667 --> 01:01:54,667
Yes or no?

1199
01:01:56,209 --> 01:01:57,250
No.

1200
01:01:57,626 --> 01:01:59,959
Look, I don't have
clarity on this either.

1201
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:01,667
I don't even know what happened to me.

1202
01:02:01,709 --> 01:02:04,250
And... I have no clue
why I'm following you around

1203
01:02:04,292 --> 01:02:06,083
as if we're connected
via Bluetooth.

1204
01:02:06,209 --> 01:02:07,751
Do you even realise
how hard this is for me?

1205
01:02:11,042 --> 01:02:12,042
Huh?

1206
01:02:13,334 --> 01:02:14,334
It's just that...

1207
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,167
you didn't ask yes or no.

1208
01:02:16,959 --> 01:02:19,083
For the love of Jesus,
don't be scared of me!

1209
01:02:19,334 --> 01:02:20,709
It makes me feel guilty
for no reason.

1210
01:02:21,542 --> 01:02:22,542
Jesus?

1211
01:02:23,334 --> 01:02:24,334
Huh?

1212
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,792
So, you're a Christian?

1213
01:02:28,709 --> 01:02:29,792
Oh! Yeah.

1214
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,250
No wonder!

1215
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:18,000
Do you sell crosses here?

1216
01:03:19,083 --> 01:03:20,083
What's the purpose?

1217
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:22,292
For...

1218
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,542
protection.

1219
01:03:23,584 --> 01:03:24,751
Protection from what?

1220
01:03:25,876 --> 01:03:27,292
No, no… just general safety.

1221
01:03:27,542 --> 01:03:28,709
Safety from what exactly?

1222
01:03:28,751 --> 01:03:30,667
For my own peace of mind, Chetta.

1223
01:03:31,292 --> 01:03:32,292
Wood or metal?

1224
01:03:33,334 --> 01:03:34,667
Which one is more powerful?

1225
01:03:34,876 --> 01:03:37,000
This isn't a light bulb
you pick by wattage.

1226
01:03:37,709 --> 01:03:39,250
That depends on your faith.

1227
01:03:39,584 --> 01:03:40,584
Lali!

1228
01:03:40,667 --> 01:03:41,709
Yes?

1229
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:43,542
Show him the crosses.

1230
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:46,542
Are you Roman Catholic?

1231
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:49,250
No.

1232
01:03:49,375 --> 01:03:50,792
Oh, from the Jacobite Church then.

1233
01:03:52,542 --> 01:03:53,876
Err...

1234
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
No.

1235
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:58,792
Mar Thoma church, then?

1236
01:04:00,125 --> 01:04:01,250
Mar...

1237
01:04:01,959 --> 01:04:02,959
Yes.

1238
01:04:04,626 --> 01:04:06,250
- Huh?
- Yes, you're right.

1239
01:04:06,292 --> 01:04:07,709
Ah, I knew it!

1240
01:04:07,751 --> 01:04:09,500
The moment I saw you,

1241
01:04:09,542 --> 01:04:11,584
I knew you were
a proper Mar Thoma boy.

1242
01:04:11,876 --> 01:04:13,167
- Yes.
- Right.

1243
01:04:13,209 --> 01:04:15,334
So, pick whichever one
you like. Okay?

1244
01:04:25,042 --> 01:04:30,542
[chants slokas]

1245
01:04:40,667 --> 01:04:42,083
So, this should clear things up, right?

1246
01:04:44,584 --> 01:04:47,000
I mean, I'm literally standing
surrounded by crosses right now.

1247
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:48,083
Including you.

1248
01:04:49,876 --> 01:04:51,584
Hey! If Jesus had a problem with me,

1249
01:04:51,626 --> 01:04:53,500
wouldn't I be gone by now?

1250
01:04:56,042 --> 01:04:57,918
Look, I honestly don't know
how I became a ghost,

1251
01:04:57,959 --> 01:05:02,167
or why I am one,
or how to stop being one.

1252
01:05:02,542 --> 01:05:03,918
And you know
what's the funny part?

1253
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,250
I can't remember
a single important detail!

1254
01:05:06,584 --> 01:05:08,083
I can't even recall my name!

1255
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Answer it.

1256
01:05:18,375 --> 01:05:20,083
- Faizal...
- Hey, Prabha...

1257
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:22,876
Wherever you are, drop everything
and get to the studio by midnight.

1258
01:05:22,918 --> 01:05:24,626
Viraj sir said he'll
join on a video call.

1259
01:05:24,667 --> 01:05:27,083
He wants to test you
for a track in his next film.

1260
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:28,584
I'm kind of stuck right now.

1261
01:05:29,209 --> 01:05:30,626
Can we reschedule?

1262
01:05:30,792 --> 01:05:33,500
Don't be an idiot, Prabha!

1263
01:05:33,876 --> 01:05:35,709
If you miss this now,
there won't be another chance.

1264
01:05:35,751 --> 01:05:38,250
I've given Saadhya my word.
Stop stalling and get here.

1265
01:05:38,292 --> 01:05:39,375
It's 5:00 PM already.

1266
01:05:39,626 --> 01:05:40,626
- I'll be there.
- Okay.

1267
01:05:45,792 --> 01:05:46,792
I heard that.

1268
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:48,250
Congrats.

1269
01:06:25,626 --> 01:06:27,250
Ah! Come in, come in.

1270
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:32,334
I didn't take the bike,
in case it rained tonight.

1271
01:06:32,459 --> 01:06:34,417
Caught a direct bus.
It was pretty comfortable.

1272
01:06:34,834 --> 01:06:36,626
You don't mind me
eating non-veg, do you?

1273
01:06:37,042 --> 01:06:38,042
Not at all.

1274
01:06:38,167 --> 01:06:39,751
I think I'll order a dosa.

1275
01:06:39,876 --> 01:06:41,125
I'll order for you, man.

1276
01:06:41,167 --> 01:06:42,167
You haven't eaten yet?

1277
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:44,542
How about podi masala dosa?

1278
01:06:45,834 --> 01:06:46,834
Yeah.

1279
01:06:46,876 --> 01:06:48,209
Who are you looking for?

1280
01:06:48,626 --> 01:06:49,626
Oh, nothing.

1281
01:06:49,876 --> 01:06:51,626
I asked if podi masala dosa is okay.

1282
01:06:51,667 --> 01:06:52,667
Yeah, that's fine.

1283
01:06:54,292 --> 01:06:56,584
Dude, hold on.
Saadhya's calling.

1284
01:06:57,167 --> 01:06:58,459
Hello, Saadhya...

1285
01:06:59,792 --> 01:07:00,792
Yeah.

1286
01:07:00,834 --> 01:07:02,042
He's logged in already?

1287
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:03,500
No, no problem.
We're coming.

1288
01:07:03,584 --> 01:07:05,876
Dude, Viraj sir has already logged in.

1289
01:07:05,918 --> 01:07:07,083
Come on, hurry up!

1290
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:08,167
What about my dosa?

1291
01:07:08,417 --> 01:07:10,792
I'm ditching my biriyani, and you're
worried about your dosa? Move!

1292
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:28,167
Prabha, ready.

1293
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:29,375
He's here.

1294
01:07:29,417 --> 01:07:30,876
Hi Faizal. All good?

1295
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,959
Hi, sir. All good, sir.
All good.

1296
01:07:33,209 --> 01:07:36,083
The guitarist. Is he ready?
What's his name?

1297
01:07:36,459 --> 01:07:38,459
Prabhendu, sir.
Prabhendu.

1298
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:39,584
Shall I call him here, sir?

1299
01:07:39,626 --> 01:07:40,834
No, no. No need.

1300
01:07:40,876 --> 01:07:42,334
I can hear what he plays, right?

1301
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:43,459
Yeah, of course. Of course.

1302
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,792
Okay then.
Let's start now.

1303
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,542
Hey...

1304
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:49,042
Sir has composed a new track.

1305
01:07:49,083 --> 01:07:50,209
He needs a guitar groove for it.

1306
01:07:50,626 --> 01:07:51,626
Kill it!

1307
01:08:24,083 --> 01:08:26,334
Faizal, I need a catchy
riff for the melody.

1308
01:08:26,375 --> 01:08:27,375
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1309
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:29,417
Prabha... 2-bar cue.

1310
01:08:29,792 --> 01:08:30,792
Yeah, okay.

1311
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,834
No, no.
Stop, stop.

1312
01:08:41,876 --> 01:08:44,083
Prabhendu, I don't want that.

1313
01:08:44,209 --> 01:08:47,000
It's not sounding good.
Try some strumming.

1314
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,417
Prabha, don't try anything
too fancy.

1315
01:08:51,459 --> 01:08:52,751
Just stick to your comfort zone.

1316
01:08:52,792 --> 01:08:53,834
Okay.

1317
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,167
No, no, no.

1318
01:09:10,334 --> 01:09:11,792
What are you doing, man?

1319
01:09:11,918 --> 01:09:14,334
Feel the melody and try again.

1320
01:09:15,959 --> 01:09:17,417
Faizal, give him a shorter cue.

1321
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:18,500
Sure. Sure, sir.

1322
01:09:19,334 --> 01:09:20,834
Prabha, what's wrong with you?

1323
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:22,500
Let's go. Ready.

1324
01:09:23,083 --> 01:09:24,292
Okay.

1325
01:09:24,751 --> 01:09:25,751
Take.

1326
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:33,584
Stop, stop, stop.

1327
01:09:33,709 --> 01:09:35,250
This is not even close!

1328
01:09:35,542 --> 01:09:36,918
Faizal, what is this?

1329
01:09:36,959 --> 01:09:38,834
I already have people in Mumbai
who play like this.

1330
01:09:39,083 --> 01:09:40,500
I want that magic!

1331
01:09:40,542 --> 01:09:43,209
We shouldn't waste our time.
Let's look for someone else.

1332
01:09:43,292 --> 01:09:44,584
He just can't do it.

1333
01:09:51,918 --> 01:09:53,375
Just follow the melody.

1334
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:57,292
Huh?!

1335
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,542
What is it, man?

1336
01:10:02,334 --> 01:10:03,500
Oh, it's nothing.

1337
01:10:04,459 --> 01:10:05,918
Prabha, focus only on the melody.

1338
01:10:06,083 --> 01:10:07,125
It's that simple.

1339
01:10:15,667 --> 01:10:16,667
Play this.

1340
01:10:19,417 --> 01:10:20,417
Prabha...

1341
01:10:20,959 --> 01:10:21,959
What do I do?

1342
01:10:23,792 --> 01:10:25,209
- Ready.
- Okay, man.

1343
01:10:25,709 --> 01:10:27,334
Sir... One last time, sir?

1344
01:10:27,959 --> 01:10:29,500
Okay, try.

1345
01:10:29,667 --> 01:10:31,167
Okay, sir.
Thank you, thank you.

1346
01:10:31,209 --> 01:10:32,250
Prabha, take.

1347
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,250
Oh, nice!
I like it!

1348
01:10:56,459 --> 01:10:58,751
Faizal, this is exactly what I want!

1349
01:10:58,834 --> 01:10:59,834
Thank you, sir.

1350
01:10:59,876 --> 01:11:01,584
Prabha, that's brilliant.
Stick with that.

1351
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:05,083
Super. Add one more layer.

1352
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,459
Faizal, turn up the reverb.

1353
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,500
I'll add one more layer.

1354
01:11:11,542 --> 01:11:12,626
Ready!

1355
01:11:21,667 --> 01:11:22,667
Too good, man!

1356
01:11:23,417 --> 01:11:24,417
Continue!

1357
01:11:42,417 --> 01:11:43,209
Too good!

1358
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:45,292
Faizal, call him!
I want to see him.

1359
01:11:45,751 --> 01:11:46,751
Sure, sir.

1360
01:11:46,959 --> 01:11:48,334
Prabha, come over here.

1361
01:11:48,417 --> 01:11:49,459
Sir wants to see you.

1362
01:11:57,834 --> 01:11:59,209
You killed it, man!

1363
01:12:00,292 --> 01:12:02,167
You just made the tune better,
Prabhendu.

1364
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:04,334
We will do the full song together
in Mumbai.

1365
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:05,417
Thank you, sir.

1366
01:12:05,542 --> 01:12:06,500
Perfect!

1367
01:12:06,542 --> 01:12:08,375
Faizal, I'll ask Saadhya to coordinate.

1368
01:12:08,417 --> 01:12:09,417
Okay.

1369
01:12:48,209 --> 01:12:49,751
Your destination is on the left.

1370
01:12:52,751 --> 01:12:53,876
Hey! Kiddo!

1371
01:13:04,542 --> 01:13:05,542
Hey, look at that.

1372
01:13:06,709 --> 01:13:08,626
To be honest,
I didn't quite get that initially.

1373
01:13:10,042 --> 01:13:11,042
Great!

1374
01:13:12,626 --> 01:13:13,667
And then?

1375
01:13:13,751 --> 01:13:15,375
That's exactly what I was thinking.

1376
01:13:15,667 --> 01:13:18,292
I know music, and I know
how guitar chords work.

1377
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:20,375
Oh Jesus!

1378
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:22,000
Kuttoos was a guitarist too!

1379
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,042
Music connects the three of us!

1380
01:13:26,209 --> 01:13:27,209
Strange!

1381
01:13:27,751 --> 01:13:29,042
Also, you're an acoustic guy?

1382
01:13:29,959 --> 01:13:31,542
Electric Guitar is my favourite.

1383
01:13:31,959 --> 01:13:33,792
But people like Viraj sir

1384
01:13:34,083 --> 01:13:36,918
usually prefer acoustic
when they're composing.

1385
01:13:36,959 --> 01:13:38,792
Ah, I see.

1386
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:42,167
Looks like you've lost your
fear and found some guts.

1387
01:13:43,292 --> 01:13:44,334
The fear is gone,

1388
01:13:44,751 --> 01:13:46,042
but the confusion remains.

1389
01:13:46,542 --> 01:13:47,751
Just relax, Prabha.

1390
01:13:47,792 --> 01:13:49,292
I think I'm just delulu.

1391
01:13:49,959 --> 01:13:52,042
Alright. So, delulu...
